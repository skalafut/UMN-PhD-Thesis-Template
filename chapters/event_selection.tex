a. angular velocity = $0.0000727 \frac{radians}{s}$\newline
angular velocity = $\frac{1 revolution}{24 hours} = \frac{6.28}{24 x 60 x 60}\frac{rad}{s}$\newline

b. centripetal accel = $0.0337 \frac{m}{s^{2}}$ \newline
$a_{centr} = R(\omega)^{2} = (6371000 m)(0.0000727 \frac{rad}{s})^{2}$\newline

c. the acceleration due to gravity is reduced by the spinning of the earth\newline
by an amount equal to the acceleration calculated in part b.  If the earth\newline
was not spinning, the accel at the equator due to gravity would increase to\newline
$9.80665 + a_{centr} = 9.84 \frac{m}{s^2}$\newline

d. weight reduced by 1.67 N\newline
weight reduction is maximized at the equator, and minimized at the poles\newline
weight reduction = $Ma_{centr}\sin(45) = \frac{Ma_{centr}}{\sqrt{2}}$ N
