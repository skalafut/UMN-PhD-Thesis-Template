a. angular velocity = $0.0000727 \frac{radians}{s}$\newline
angular velocity = $\frac{1 revolution}{24 hours} = \frac{6.28}{24 x 60 x 60}\frac{rad}{s}$\newline

b. centripetal accel = $0.0337 \frac{m}{s^{2}}$ \newline
$a_{centr} = R(\omega)^{2} = (6371000 m)(0.0000727 \frac{rad}{s})^{2}$\newline

c. the acceleration due to gravity is reduced by the spinning of the earth\newline
by an amount equal to the acceleration calculated in part b.  If the earth\newline
was not spinning, the accel at the equator due to gravity would increase to\newline
$9.80665 + a_{centr} = 9.84 \frac{m}{s^2}$\newline

d. weight reduced by 1.18 N\newline
$g_{0}$ = measured gravitational constant if earth was not spinning
weight reduction is maximized at the equator, and minimized at the poles.\newline
if $\theta = 90$ degrees at the equator and $\theta =$ 0 degrees at the poles, then\newline
at some angle $\theta$ the force of weight can be split into two components.\newline
$W_{y} = mg_{0}\cos(\theta)$\newline
$W_{x} = mg_{0}\sin(\theta) - ma_{centr}(\theta)$, where $a_{centr}(\theta) = R(\omega)^{2}\sin(\theta)$\newline
because the centripetal acceleration also decreases as $\theta$ decreases from 90.\newline
the reduction in your weight due to the spinning of the earth is given by\newline
$mg_{0} - \sqrt{W_{x}^{2} + W_{y}^{2}} \rightarrow = ma_{centr}(\theta)\sin(\theta)$
