a. $0.71$ seconds to travel half way down the ramp

first find the acceleration a which moves the mass through a distance $d = 1.20$
meters in a time $t_{b} = 1.00$ seconds

d = (1/2)a$t_{b}^{2}$ $\rightarrow$ a = $\frac{2d}{t_{b}^{2}}$ = $2.40 \frac{m}{s^{2}}$

now find the time $t_{c}$ required to travel d/2

d/2 = (1/2)a$t_{c}^{2}$ $\rightarrow$ $t_{c}$ = $\sqrt{ \frac{d}a{} }$ = $0.707$ seconds


b. $1.70 \frac{m}{s}$

speed = $|velocity|$ = a$t_{c}$ = $1.697 \frac{m}{s}$

c. $2.40 \frac{m}{s}$

at the bottom time = $t_{b} \rightarrow$ speed = a$t_{b}$ = $2.40 \frac{m}{s}$

d. the ramp is inclined upwards at $14.2$ degrees

The weight of the object is accelerating the object down the ramp.  From a free
body diagram the magnitude of this acceleration can be found to be

acceleration a = g$\sin( \theta )$ = g$\sin(q)$

where q is the angle of incline.  If there was no incline q would be zero, and
the acceleration would be zero.  If the ramp pointed straight up, the mass would be
in free fall, and the acceleration would be g.

q = incline angle = $\arcsin( \frac{a}{g} )$ = $0.247$ radians or $14.2$ degrees
