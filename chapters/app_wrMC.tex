Events from \WR interactions, characterized by different \mnul and \mWR, are simulated in the same three steps used to simulate 
background interactions, described in Chapter \ref{sec:backgroundEstimation}.  The \PYTHIA generator implements a flexible, generic 
\WR signal model that captures the main characteristics of theoretical models discussed in the literature 
\cite{earlyLRSModel,lrsHiggsStageOne,lrsHiggsStageTwo,seeSawAndParityViolation,seeSawAndGUTs,lrsMassConstraints}, so \PYTHIA was used 
to simulate $\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj$ events.

Two classes of \WR signal events were simulated using \PYTHIA: one class was simulated through all three simulation steps, the other 
was simulated only through the first step.  Events simulated through all three steps were produced with \mWR stepping from 0.8 to 6 
$\TeV$ in increments of 0.2 $\TeV$, and $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$.  Those events were used to calculate cross section $\times$ branching 
ratio limits on the $\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj$ process as a function of \mWR.  The other class of events were produced with \mWR 
stepping from 0.8 to 4.0 $\TeV$ in increments of 0.1 $\TeV$, and several \mnul values between $0.1 \leq \mnul < \mWR$ $\TeV$ at each 
value of \mWR.  If no \WR signal is found, these events are used to transform the cross section $\times$ branching ratio limits for 
$\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$ into \mWR and \mnul exclusion limits for 100 $\GeV$ $\lesssim \mnul < \mWR$.
