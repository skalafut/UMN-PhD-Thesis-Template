\label{app_glossary}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Care has been taken in this thesis to minimize the use of jargon and
acronyms, but this cannot always be achieved.  This appendix defines
jargon terms in a glossary, and contains a table of acronyms and their
meaning.

\begin{itemize}

%\item \textbf{Cosmic-Ray Muon} (\textbf{CR $\mu$}) -- A muon coming from
%the abundant energetic particles originating outside of the Earth's
%atmosphere.
	\item \textbf{barrel} -- The central $\eta$ region of each sub-detector is 
		called the barrel.
	\item \textbf{endcap} -- The high $\eta$ region of each sub-detector is 
		called the endcap.
	\item \textbf{hadronization} -- The process through which bare quarks and 
		gluons become color neutral hadrons.
	\item \textbf{interaction point} -- The region at the center of the detector 
		where proton-proton interactions occur.
	\item \textbf{pileup} -- Additional proton-proton interactions that occur 
		in the same collision event.
	\item \textbf{reconstruction} -- The process through which detector information 
		is transformed into particles used in physics analyses.
	%\item \textbf{Supercluster} (\textbf{SC}) -- A 5 $\times$ 5 crystal region 
	%	in the Electromagnetic Calorimeter.
