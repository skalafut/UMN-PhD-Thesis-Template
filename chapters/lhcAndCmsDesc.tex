\subsection{The Large Hadron Collider}
\begin{itemize}
	\item sqrt s, inst lumi
	\item 27 km circumference
	\item need high energy and inst lumi to search for weakly coupled interactions with heavy mediating particles
	\item high energy and lumi drive dramatically increase rate of low energy and other abundant processes. explain these
	\item QCD multijet event rate at LHC is O(100 kHz), CMS readout capability is O(100 Hz) $\rightarrow$ need fast, efficient trigger system
	\item describe 2015 run conditions - cause of PU, PU range observed in data, consequences on trigger, offline reco and analysis
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Compact Muon Solenoid Detector Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item general design goals which ultimately focus down to WR search
	\item brief description of each subdetector and magnet
	\item trigger description, followed by particle flow event reconstruction
\end{itemize}
