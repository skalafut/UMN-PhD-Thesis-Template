The general LRS model builds on the ST of particle physics, and predicts massive neutrinos \nul and a new, heavier charged 
gauge boson \WR.  Considering specific LRS model realizations that could be tested at the LHC, evidence of the \WR and \nul 
was searched for using the 2.6 fb$^{-1}$ of data delivered by the LHC and collected by the CMS detector in 2015.  Evidence 
was searched for in the $eejj$ and $\mu\mu jj$ final states as an excess of events in data relative to ST backgrounds in the 
$\Mlljj$ distribution.  No statistically significant excess was found in data relative to ST backgrounds 
in either lepton channel, so the data was used to set upper limits on the $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\ell\ell jj)$ at 95\% CL 
assuming $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$.  These limits were extrapolated into exclusion limits on \mWR and \mnul for any 
$\mnul < \mWR$.  The resulting mass limits excluded \WR production at 95\% CL for $\mWR < 3500$ $\GeV$ in the $\mu\mu$-channel, 
and for $\mWR < 3300$ $\GeV$ in the $ee$-channel, depending on \mnul.

The 2015 data was used to extend the \WR and \nul exclusion limits in both lepton channels 400 $\GeV$ higher in \mWR, and $\geq$ 
150 $\GeV$ higher in \mnul relative to the Run I limits \cite{cmsWRRunOneResults}.  In addition, no evidence of the Run I 
$ee$-channel excess was found.

Areas of the $(\mWR, \mnul)$ phase space that could not be probed using 2015 data can be studied using different techniques and 
newer data collected by CMS.  Evidence of the \WR and \nul at higher \mWR and \mnul is being searched for using the 37.8 fb$^{-1}$ 
of data \cite{lumi} collected by CMS in 2016.  The event selection applied to events in 2016 data is nearly identical to the 
event selection described in this thesis, so that search will not be sensitive to LRS models 
that predict $\mnul \lesssim \frac{1}{8}\mWR$.  This low \mnul phase space can be studied using existing or future data collected 
by CMS, and a different event selection that selects low \mnul simulated signal events with higher efficiency.
