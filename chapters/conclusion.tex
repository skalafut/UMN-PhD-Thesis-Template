The general LRS model builds on the ST of particle physics, and predicts massive neutrinos \nul and a new, heavier charged 
gauge boson \WR.  Considering specific LRS model realizations that could be tested at the LHC, evidence of the \WR and \nul 
was searched for using the 2.6 fb$^{-1}$ of data delivered by the LHC and collected by the CMS detector in 2015.  Their 
existence was searched for as an excess of events in data relative to ST backgrounds in the $\Mlljj$ distribution in events 
with two high energy jets, and two same flavor, high energy leptons - two electrons or two muons.  No statistically significant 
excess of events was found in data relative to ST backgrounds in either lepton channel, so the data was used to set limits on 
the \WR cross section $\times$ branching ratio to $\ell\ell jj$ final states at 95\% CL assuming $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$.  Knowing that 
the cross section limits at two points $(\mWR^{a},\mnul^{a})$ and $(\mWR^{a},\mnul^{b})$ were related by a multiplicative 
constant, the cross section limits calculated for $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$ were extrapolated to cross section limits for 
$\mnul \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR$.  Subsequently, cross section limits at all points in the $(\mWR, \mnul)$ plane were scaled 
by the \WR cross section at each point into 95\% CL exclusion limits on \mWR and \mnul.  \WR production was excluded as far 
as 3500 $\GeV$ in the $\mu\mu$-channel, and as far as 3300 $\GeV$ in the $ee$-channel, depending on \mnul.  .

%Using 2015 data \mWR production was excluded at 95\% CL for $\mWR \lesssim 3500 (3300) \GeV$ in the $\mu\mu$- ($ee$-) channel.  
%The exclusion limits were consistent with ST expectations, and relative to the Run I limits, the mass limits in the $\mu\mu$- 
%($ee$-) channel were extended 400 $\GeV$ (400 $\GeV$) higher in \mWR, and 150 $\GeV$ (300 $\GeV$) higher in \mnul.
