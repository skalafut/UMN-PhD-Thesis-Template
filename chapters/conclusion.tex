The general LRS model extends the Standard Theory of particle physics by predicting massive neutrinos \nul and a heavy charged 
gauge boson \WR.  Through a see-saw mechanism the low ST neutrino masses are explained by the large \mnul, in excess of the $Z$ 
boson mass.  In addition, the large mass difference between the \WR and ST $W$ boson represents an additional source of CP 
violation, which helps to explain the large abundance of baryonic matter relative to baryonic antimatter.  Evidence of the \WR 
and \nul was searched for as an excess of data relative to predicted backgrounds in the $\Meejj$ and $\Mmumujj$ distributions.  
No statistically significant excess was found, so the data was used to set upper limits on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\ell\ell jj)$ 
at 95\% CL assuming $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$.  These limits were extrapolated into exclusion limits on \mWR and \mnul for 
$\mnul < \mWR$.  The resulting mass limits excluded \WR production at 95\% CL for $\mWR < 3500$ $\GeV$ in the $\mu\mu$-channel, 
and for $\mWR < 3300$ $\GeV$ in the $ee$-channel, depending on \mnul.  Relative to the Run I mass limits \cite{cmsWRRunOneResults}, 
the mass limits were extended 400 $\GeV$ higher in \mWR, and at least 150 $\GeV$ higher in \mnul.  In addition, no evidence of 
the 2.8$\sigma$ Run I excess in the $ee$-channel was found.

Areas of the $(\mWR, \mnul)$ phase space that could not be probed using 2015 data, like $\mWR \gtrsim 4$ $\TeV$ and $\mnul < 
\frac{1}{8}\mWR$ for all \mWR, are being studied using newer data, and in the future may be studied using different event selection 
criteria.  Evidence of the \WR and \nul at higher \mWR and \mnul is being searched for using the 37.8 fb$^{-1}$ of data \cite{lumi} 
collected by CMS in 2016.  The event selection applied to events in 2016 data is nearly identical to the event selection described 
in this thesis, so the search using 2016 data is not sensitive to LRS models that predict $\mnul \lesssim \frac{1}{8}\mWR$.  In 
the future this low \mnul phase space can be studied using CMS data, and a different event selection criteria that select low \mnul, 
high \mWR events with higher efficiency.  Such selection criteria should include lower lepton and jet $\pt$ criteria, and could include 
a larger $\Mll$ criteria and a larger $\Delta R$ separation between the leading lepton and both jets.
