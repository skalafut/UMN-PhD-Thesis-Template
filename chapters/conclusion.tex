The LRS model extends the Standard Theory of particle physics to explains the low ST neutrino masses, and the large 
abundance of baryons relative to anti-baryons in the universe.  The model predicts heavy neutrinos \nul that couple to a heavy, 
charged \WR boson.  The \WR couples to quarks, so it can be produced in proton-proton collisions.  In events with two charged 
leptons and two jets collected by the CMS experiment in 2015, evidence of a \WR and \nul was searched for as an excess of data 
above the predicted background in the $\Meejj$ and $\Mmumujj$ distributions.  No statistically significant excess was found, so 
the data was used to set upper limits on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\ell\ell jj)$ at 95\% CL for $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$, which 
were extrapolated into exclusion limits on \mWR and \mnul for $\mnul < \mWR$.  The limit excludes $\mWR < 3500$ 
$\GeV$ and $\mnul < 2200$ $\GeV$ in the $\mu\mu$-channel, and $\mWR < 3300$ $\GeV$ and $\mnul < 2200$ $\GeV$ in the $ee$-channel.  
Relative to the Run I mass limits \cite{cmsWRRunOneResults}, the mass limits were extended 400 $\GeV$ higher in \mWR, and at least 
150 $\GeV$ higher in \mnul.  In addition, no evidence of the 2.8$\sigma$ significance excess from Run I in the $ee$-channel was found.

Areas of the $(\mWR, \mnul)$ phase space that could not be probed using the data, like $\mWR \gtrsim 4$ $\TeV$ and $\mnul < 
\frac{1}{8}\mWR$ for all \mWR, are being studied using newer data.  Evidence of the \WR and \nul with $\mWR > 3500$ $\GeV$ and 
$\mnul > 2200$ $\GeV$ is being searched for using the 37.8 fb$^{-1}$ of data \cite{lumi} collected by CMS in 2016.  The event selection 
applied to events in 2016 data is nearly identical to the event selection described in this thesis, so the search using 2016 data will 
not have significantly more sensitivity to LRS models that predict $\mnul \lesssim \frac{1}{8}\mWR$.  A separate analysis using the 
2016 data is searching for evidence of a \WR and \nul in the phase space where the \nul mass is light relative to the \WR mass, 
$\mnul < \frac{1}{8}\mWR$.  In this search, events are selected using a completely different set of selection criteria that are optimized 
for signals with low \nul mass and high \WR mass, such as a smaller $\Delta R$ separation requirement between the leptons and jets.
