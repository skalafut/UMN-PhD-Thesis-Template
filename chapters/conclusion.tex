The general LRS model builds on the ST of particle physics, and predicts massive neutrinos \nul and a new, heavier charged 
gauge boson \WR.  Considering specific LRS model realizations that could be tested at the LHC, evidence of the \WR and \nul 
was searched for using the 2.6 fb$^{-1}$ of data delivered by the LHC and collected by the CMS detector in 2015.  Evidence 
was searched for in the $eejj$ and $\mu\mu jj$ final states as an excess of events in data relative to ST backgrounds in the 
$\Mlljj$ distribution.  No statistically significant excess was found in data relative to ST backgrounds 
in either lepton channel, so the data was used to set upper limits on the $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\ell\ell jj)$ at 95\% CL 
assuming $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$.  These limits were extrapolated into exclusion limits on \mWR and \mnul for any 
$\mnul < \mWR$.  The resulting mass limits excluded \WR production at 95\% CL for $\mWR < 3500$ $\GeV$ in the $\mu\mu$-channel, 
and for $\mWR < 3300$ $\GeV$ in the $ee$-channel, depending on \mnul.

The 2015 data was used to extend the \WR and \nul exclusion limits in both lepton channels 400 $\GeV$ higher in \mWR, and $\geq$ 
150 $\GeV$ higher in \mnul relative to the Run I limits \cite{cmsWRRunOneResults}.  In addition, no evidence of the Run I 
$ee$-channel excess was found.  Evidence of the \WR and \nul is being searched for using the data collected by CMS in 2016, and 
thanks to the 37.8 fb$^{-1}$ of data \cite{lumi} collected in 2016, the results will be sensitive to heavier \WR and \nul.
