The general LRS model extends the Standard Theory of particle physics to explains the low ST neutrino masses, and the large 
abundance of baryons relative to anti-baryons in the universe.  The model predicts heavy neutrinos \nul that couple to a heavy, 
charged \WR boson.  The \WR couples to quarks, so it can be produced in proton-proton collisions.  In events with two charged 
leptons and two jets collected by the CMS experiment in 2015, evidence of a \WR and \nul was searched for as an excess of data 
above the predicted background in the $\Meejj$ and $\Mmumujj$ distributions.  No statistically significant excess was found.  
The data was used to set upper limits on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\ell\ell jj)$ at 95\% CL for $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$, which 
were extrapolated into exclusion limits on \mWR and \mnul for $\mnul < \mWR$.  The limit excludes $\mWR < 3500$ 
$\GeV$ and $\mnul < 2200$ $\GeV$ in the $\mu\mu$-channel, and $\mWR < 3300$ $\GeV$ and $\mnul < 2200$ $\GeV$ in the $ee$-channel.  
Relative to the Run I mass limits \cite{cmsWRRunOneResults}, the mass limits were extended 400 $\GeV$ higher in \mWR, and at least 
150 $\GeV$ higher in \mnul.  In addition, no evidence of the 2.8$\sigma$ significance excess from Run I in the $ee$-channel was found.

Areas of the $(\mWR, \mnul)$ phase space that could not be probed using the data, like $\mWR \gtrsim 4$ $\TeV$ and $\mnul < 
\frac{1}{8}\mWR$ for all \mWR, are being studied using newer data, and may be studied using different event selection criteria in 
the future.  Evidence of the \WR and \nul with $\mWR > 3500$ $\GeV$ and $\mnul > 2200$ $\GeV$ is being searched for using the 37.8 
fb$^{-1}$ of data \cite{lumi} collected by CMS in 2016.  The event selection applied to events in 2016 data is nearly identical to 
the event selection described in this thesis, so the search using 2016 data will not have significantly more sensitivity to LRS models 
that predict $\mnul \lesssim \frac{1}{8}\mWR$.  In the future this low \mnul phase space can be studied using data events that 
are selected with selection criteria that are optimized for signals with low \mnul and high \mWR.  Such selection criteria could 
include lower lepton and jet $\pt$ requirements, a higher $\Mll$ requirement, and a larger $\Delta R$ separation requirement between 
the leading lepton and both jets.
