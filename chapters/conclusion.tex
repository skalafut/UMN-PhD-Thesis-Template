The general LRS model builds on the ST of particle physics by predicting massive neutrinos \nul and a new, heavier charged 
gauge boson \WR.  Considering specific LRS model realizations that could be tested at the LHC, evidence of the \WR and \nul 
were searched for using the 2.6 fb$^{-1}$ of data delivered by the LHC and collected by the CMS detector in 2015.  The .

%Using 2015 data \mWR production was excluded at 95\% CL for $\mWR \lesssim 3500 (3300) \GeV$ in the $\mu\mu$- ($ee$-) channel.  
%The exclusion limits were consistent with ST expectations, and relative to the Run I limits, the mass limits in the $\mu\mu$- 
%($ee$-) channel were extended 400 $\GeV$ (400 $\GeV$) higher in \mWR, and 150 $\GeV$ (300 $\GeV$) higher in \mnul.
