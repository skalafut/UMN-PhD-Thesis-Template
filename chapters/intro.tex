The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a quantum field theory that describes the fundamental 
components of matter and their interactions.  The SM was proposed by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam in 
1967 \cite{weinbergSM,salamSM}, and postulates that spin $\frac{1}{2}$ fermions represent matter, and 
integer spin bosons mediate interactions between matter.  Matter is categorized into three generations 
of fermions, each with one doublet of massive charged quarks, and one doublet with a massive charged 
lepton and a massless neutral lepton (neutrino).  The SM also includes anti-particles of all fermions.  
The first generation of particles, which are the up and down quarks, and the electron $e^{-}$ and electron 
neutrino $\nu_{e}$, build the human body and every material and substance that humans are able to sense.  
The second generation contains the muon and muon neutrino, and the charm and strange quark, and the 
third generation contains the tau and tau neutrino, and the top and bottom quark.  .

The SM describes the electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear interactions using one framework 
where quantized parameters of SM fermions, like electric charge, drive interactions between fermions.  
Each interaction can transform one set of fermions into a different set, and conserves the quantized 
parameter that drives the interaction.  The interactions are represented mathematically by gauge groups, and the 
gauge bosons that mediate interactions are represented by combinations of gauge group 
generators.  The strong interaction, which conserves color charge and is represented by the $SU(3)_{C}$ 
group, occurs between quarks and is mediated by gluons, which are represented by the $SU(3)_{C}$ group 
generators.  The proton is built from two positively charged up quarks and one negatively charged down 
quark, and is stable because the attraction between quarks from the strong interaction overwhelms the 
electromagnetic repulsion between the two up quarks.  The groups $SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)$ represent the 
electromagnetic interaction between charged fermions, and the weak nuclear interaction between all fermions.  
The electromagnetic interaction conserves electric charge, and is mediated by the photon.  The weak 
interaction conserves weak isospin and hypercharge, and is mediated by the charged $W^{\pm}$ and neutral 
$Z$.  For reasons discussed in Chapter \ref{wrBosonAndHeavyNu}, the photon, $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ are 
represented by combinations of the $SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)$ group generators.

Color charge, color neutral stability and asymptotic freedom drive the dynamics of the strong interaction.  
Every quark is produced with one of six possible color charges: red, blue, green, or anti-colors.  Gluons 
that mediate the strong interaction carry two different color charges, like red and blue, or anti-blue and 
green.  Color charge is conserved in strong interactions, and only color neutral quark bound states are 
quasi-stable\footnote{mean lifetime $\gtrsim 10^{-25}$ seconds}.  Thus, a pair of quarks that are red and 
anti-red, or a triplet of quarks, like the proton, that are red, blue and green are quasi-stable bound states.  
When a proton-proton collision produces a free quark with too much energy to form a color neutral bound state, 
the strong interaction works to maintain color neutrality.  A property of the strong interaction called 
asymptotic freedom allows the free quark to travel a finite distance away from the other final state quarks 
before the strong interaction acts to maintain color neutrality.  Once this distance becomes too large, the 
strong interaction restores color neutrality by creating an energetic gluon in the vicinity of the free quark.  This 
gluon decays to a quark and anti-quark, of which at least one has the correct color charge to 
form a color neutral bound state with the initial free quark.  If the new quark and anti-quark do not 
form a color neutral, 3 quark bound state with the initial free quark, the process of quark anti-quark 
pair production will continue until all quarks in the final state form color neutral bound states.  If 
instead a proton-proton collision produces a free gluon, the gluon decays to a quark and anti-quark with 
different colors, and the process described for one free quark ensues for both quark and anti-quark.  For 
the remainder of this thesis, the shower of color neutral hadrons originating from a free quark or gluon is 
called a jet.

The SM neutrinos and their interactions mediated by $W^{\pm}$ play an important role in particle physics.  
Neutrinos were first proposed in 1929 to preserve energy conservation in beta decays, where an unstable 
neutron decayed to a proton and other particles by emitting a $W^{-}$ boson.  Experimental evidence of 
neutrinos first came in 1956, when a search for inverse beta decay resulted in the discovery of the electron 
neutrino \cite{firstNuDiscovery}.  Experimental evidence of the muon and tau neutrinos came later \cite{muNuDiscovery,tauNuDiscovery}.  
The .



Experimental evidence \cite{NOvAresults,mainzPhaseIIResults,t2kResults} 
substantiates that neutrinos have mass, and are several orders of magnitude lighter than the lightest charged 
lepton or quark.  To accommodate massive neutrinos, the SM must be extended.  A consequence of this extension is the 
possibility that heavier neutrinos $\nul$, and heavier charged weak bosons $W^{\pm}_{R}$ (\WR) exist.

The SM neutrinos and their interactions mediated by $W^{\pm}$ play an important role in particle 
physics.  Neutrinos were first proposed by Pauli in 1929 to preserve energy conservation in beta decays.  It took 
nearly thirty years for experimental proof of neutrinos, when in 1956 Reines and Cowan discovered electron neutrinos while 
searching for inverse beta decay \cite{firstNuDiscovery}.  Experimental proof of the second (muon) and third (tau) neutrino flavors came in 
1962 \cite{muNuDiscovery} and 2000 \cite{tauNuDiscovery}.  Neutrino flavor oscillations, first predicted by Pontecorvo in 1957, suggest that 
neutrinos have mass.  Later, results from solar electron neutrino experiments \cite{kamiokandeTwo,solarNuSummary} motivated 
dedicated neutrino oscillation experiments.  There, neutrinos interact with protons and neutrons in a detector through 
$W^{\pm}$ exchange, and neutrinos are transformed into detectable charged leptons of the same flavor.  Results from 
oscillation experiments support SM extensions in which the known neutrinos have mass, and additional heavy neutrinos 
$N_{l}$ and heavy weak bosons $W^{\pm}_{R}$ exist.

Heavy neutrinos $N_{l}$ and weak bosons $W^{\pm}_{R}$ predicted by SM extensions can be identified through a larger 
than expected number of observed events with two charged SM leptons and two hadronic jets.  A $W^{\pm}_{R}$ can 
decay to an unstable heavy neutrino $N_{l}$ and a same flavor, SM charged lepton $l_{1}$.  Subsequently, the 
neutrino $N_{l}$ can decay to a second, same flavor charged lepton $l_{2}$ and a virtual $W^{*}_{R}$.  The $W^{*}_{R}$ can 
decay to two SM quarks that hadronize into jets $j_{1}$ and $j_{2}$, thus yielding the final state $l_{1}l_{2}j_{1}j_{2}$.  
This final state is also produced by SM processes, principally those that produce one or more top quarks, or 
a $Z$ boson in association with quarks or gluons.  However, in the mass distributions $M_{lljj}$ and $M_{ljj}$ 
of the final state particles, all SM backgrounds manifest as a distribution that decreases rapidly with increasing 
mass, whereas the $W^{\pm}_{R}$ and $N_{l}$ signal appears as a finite width peak centered on the $W^{\pm}_{R}$ 
or $N_{l}$ mass value.

This thesis presents a search for heavy neutrinos $N_{l}$ and weak bosons $W^{\pm}_{R}$ in the CMS data collected 
in 2015 using the CERN Large Hadron Collider.
