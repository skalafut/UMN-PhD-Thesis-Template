Experimental evidence of massive neutrinos and the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry motivates extensions to the SM.  
In this chapter, the SM description of particle mass generation is discussed as a precursor to SM extensions.  
Then, the Majorana neutrino model and generic LRS models are explained, and highlighting how these extensions 
show better agreement with experimental observations than the SM.  Finally, this chapter concludes with 
important characteristics of LRS models that can be tested at the LHC, and their predicted experimental signatures 
of \WR and \nul production.


\section{Particle Masses in the Standard Model}
\label{sec:massInSM}
The SM postulates that the four generators of the $SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)$ groups transform into the massless 
photon and massive $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons through the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism.  This mechanism 
introduces a complex doublet $\Phi$, representing four scalar bosons, that obey the Lagrangian $\Ell_{H}$:

\begin{align}
	\Phi &= \begin{bmatrix}
	\phi^{+} \\
	\phi^{0}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
	\Ell_{H} = (D_{\mu}\Phi)^{\dagger}D^{\mu}\Phi - V(\Phi)
\end{equation}

where $V(\Phi) = \frac{1}{2}(|\Phi|^{2} - \frac{\nu^{2}}{2})$ is the Higgs potential (see Figure \ref{fig:smHiggsPotential}), and 
$D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + ig_{L}\tau^{j}A^{j}_{\mu} + i\frac{g'}{2}YB_{\mu}$ describes the propagation 
of the Higgs doublet $\Phi$ and its couplings to the $SU(2)_{L}$ and $U(1)$ generators $\tau^{j}$ and $Y$, 
and to the massless vector fields $A^{j}_{\mu}$ and $B_{\mu}$.  $g_{L}$ and 
$g'$ set the weak and electromagnetic interaction coupling strengths.  The Higgs doublet $\Phi$ naturally 
moves to a value $<\Phi> =$ (0  $\nu/\sqrt{2}$) to minimize the Higgs potential, after which $\Ell_{H}$ reduces 
to:

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/mexicanHatPotential.jpg}
	\caption{The potential that drives the SM Higgs field to a stable state with non-zero vacuum expectation value \cite{higgsPotential}.}
	\label{fig:smHiggsPotential}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
	\Ell_{HK} = \frac{\nu^{2}}{8}[g^{2}_{L}(A^{1}_{\mu} + iA^{2}_{\mu})(A^{1\mu} - iA^{2\mu}) + (g'B_{\mu} - g_{L}A^{3}_{\mu})^{2}]
\end{equation}

Defining the photon vector field $A_{\mu}$, and the weak boson vector fields $W^{\pm}_{\mu}$ and $Z_{\mu}$ as:

\begin{equation}
	W^{\pm}_{\mu} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(A^{1}_{\mu} \pm iA^{2}_{\mu}), 
	Z_{\mu} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{g'^{2} + g^{2}_{L}}}(g'B_{\mu} - g_{L}A^{3}_{\mu}), 
	A_{\mu} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{g'^{2} + g^{2}_{L}}}(g_{L}B_{\mu} + g'A^{3}_{\mu})
\end{equation}

transforms $\Ell_{H}$ into:

\begin{equation}
	\Ell_{HK} = (\frac{\nu g_{L}}{2})^{2}W^{+}_{\mu}W^{-\mu} + \frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu \bar{g}}{2})^{2}Z_{\mu}Z^{\mu} + 0A_{\mu}A^{\mu}
\end{equation}

where $\bar{g} \equiv \sqrt{g'^{2} + g^{2}_{L}}$.  Following from this Lagrangian, the photon $A_{\mu}$ is massless, 
the $Z$ boson has mass $m_{Z} = \nu\bar{g}/2$, and the $W^{\pm}$ bosons have mass $m_{W} = \nu g_{L}/2$.  
Three of the four scalar fields introduced by the BEH mechanism are consumed to give mass to the $Z$ 
and $W^{\pm}$ bosons.  Recent experimental evidence of the fourth scalar field \cite{combinedHiggsResult}, the Higgs boson, 
supports the SM prediction that the $Z$ and $W^{\pm}$ bosons acquire mass through the BEH mechanism.

Experimental evidence indicates that quarks and charged leptons are massive fermions.  In the SM, fermions 
can acquire mass by adding mass terms directly to the SM Lagrangian, or by adding more Higgs fields to the 
BEH mechanism.  In either case, mass terms of the form $-mf\bar{f}$, where $f$ is a fermion, are added to 
the SM Lagrangian.  In the basis where a fermion field $f$ consists of right and left-handed components $\chi_{R}$ 
and $\chi_{L}$, $f = (\chi_{L},\chi_{R})$, a fermion mass term in the SM Lagrangian is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
	\Ell_{D} = -m\bar{f}f = -m\chi^{\dagger}_{L}\chi_{R} - m\chi^{\dagger}_{R}\chi_{L}
\end{equation}

This type of mass term, called a Dirac mass, contains the product of left and right-handed fields.  Experimental 
evidence substantiates that quarks and charged leptons exist in left and right-handed states that are degenerate 
in mass, so Dirac mass terms are used to assign masses to fermions in the SM.

Neutrinos play a special role in the SM.  The SM predicts that they are neutral, massless fermions, and only interact 
through the weak interaction.  In addition, due to parity violation of the weak interaction, 
anti-neutrinos $\bar{\nu_{\ell}}$ are always right-handed, and neutrinos $\nu_{\ell}$ are always left-handed.  
The SM can only assign masses to fermions using Dirac mass terms, which depend on the product of left and 
right-handed fields.  A Dirac mass term for neutrinos yields a mass of zero, so a SM extension is needed 
to model the experimental observation of massive neutrinos.


\section{Standard Model Extensions}
\label{sec:lrsExtensions}
The SM can be extended in several ways to accommodate massive, fermionic neutrinos.  One of the simplest 
extensions predicts that neutrinos are not Dirac fermions, but Majorana fermions.  First proposed\cite{majoranaTheory} 
in 1937, Majorana fermions are their own anti-particles, and have masses $m_{L},m_{R}$ defined by the 
Lagrangian $\Ell_{M}$:

\begin{equation}
	\Ell_{M} = -m_{L}\chi^{\dagger}_{L}\chi_{L} - m_{R}\chi^{\dagger}_{R}\chi_{R}
\end{equation}

The individual Majorana masses can be generated through an extended Higgs model, or adding terms of the 
form $\Ell_{M}$ directly to the SM Lagrangian.  However, if Majorana neutrinos existed in nature, then 
the double beta decay process could occur with no neutrinos.  Experimental evidence of neutrinoless double 
beta decay has not been found \cite{igexDblBetaDecay,gerdaDblBetaDecay}, so a different SM extension is 
needed to predict massive neutrinos.

LRS models also predict massive fermionic neutrinos, but are not as tightly constrained by experimental 
evidence as the Majorana neutrino model.
First proposed in 1974 \cite{earlyLRSModel}, LRS models predict that a precursor to the SM electroweak 
interaction existed in the very early universe, and it conserved parity and was mediated by seven massless 
gauge bosons.  An extension of the SM BEH mechanism transformed the seven massless gauge bosons 
into the massless photon, the SM weak bosons, and the heavier $W^{\pm}_{R}$ (\WR) and $Z'$ bosons.  
The mechanism through which the SM weak bosons, \WR and $Z'$ bosons acquired mass is discussed next, 
followed by a discussion of neutrino masses in LRS models.

The LRS models considered here add a $SU(2)_{R}$ group to the SM electroweak $SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)$ groups.
Adding the $SU(2)_{R}$ group introduces three massless vector fields $\xi^{j}_{\mu}$, which become massive 
bosons through an extended version of the SM BEH mechanism.  The SM BEH mechanism is extended in two stages, 
and ultimately yields one massless and six massive gauge bosons that mediate electroweak interactions.  In 
the first stage \cite{lrsHiggsStageOne}, a chiral, complex Higgs doublet $\chi_{L,R}$ is introduced: 

\begin{align}
	\chi_{L,R} &= \begin{bmatrix}
	\chi^{+}_{L,R} \\
	\chi^{0}_{L,R}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\label{eq:stageOneVEV}
\end{align}

with bosonic fields that couple independently to left and right-handed gauge bosons.  The propagation and 
interaction of these fields with other massless bosons is described by the Lagrangian:

\begin{equation}
	\Ell_{H,LRS} = \frac{1}{2}(D_{\mu}\chi_{L})^{\dagger}D^{\mu}\chi_{L} + \frac{1}{2}(D_{\mu}\chi_{R})^{\dagger}D^{\mu}\chi_{R} - V(\chi_{L,R})
\end{equation}

where $D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + ig_{L}\tau^{j}A^{j}_{L\mu} + ig_{R}\tau^{j}\xi^{j}_{R\mu} + i\frac{g'}{2}YB_{\mu}$ contains 
the massless boson fields $A^{j}_{L\mu}, \xi^{j}_{R\mu}, B_{\mu}$ multiplied by the generators of the $SU(2)_{L}, SU(2)_{R}, U(1)$ groups.  
In the LRS models considered here the coupling strengths $g_{R}, g_{L}$ were assumed to be equal, and denoted as $g$.  
The potential $V(\chi_{L,R})$ respects the symmetries of LRS models, and depends on a constant $U_{R}$.  $\chi_{L,R}$ 
naturally moved to $<\chi^{+}_{L,R}> = 0, <\chi^{0}_{L}> = 0, <\chi^{0}_{R}> = U_{R}$ to minimize $V(\chi_{L,R})$, 
and subsequently new fields were created:

\begin{equation}
	W^{\pm}_{R\mu} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\xi^{1}_{R\mu} \mp i\xi^{2}_{R\mu}), 
	Z'_{\mu} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{g'^{2} + g^{2}}}(-g'B_{\mu} + g\xi^{3}_{R\mu})
\end{equation}

with masses:

\begin{equation}
	\Ell_{HK,LRS} = (\frac{1}{4}U^{2}_{R}g^{2})W^{+\mu}_{R}W^{-}_{R\mu} + \frac{1}{2}[\frac{1}{4}U^{2}_{R}(g^{2} + g'^{2})]Z'_{\mu}Z'^{\mu}
\end{equation}

The first stage extension of the BEH mechanism creates the $W^{\pm}_{R}, Z'$ bosons with masses $m_{W_{R}} = \frac{1}{2}gU_{R}$ 
and $m_{Z'} = \frac{1}{2}U_{R}\sqrt{g'^{2} + g^{2}}$, and all other bosons remain massless.
%%%RESUME HERE%%%%%%%%%%%
Following the first stage, the second stage extension of the BEH mechanism \cite{lrsHiggsStageOne,lrsHiggsStageTwo} introduced two complex Higgs doublets 
$\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$ represented by the multiplet $\Phi$:

\begin{align}
	\Phi &= \begin{bmatrix}
	\phi^{0}_{1} & \phi^{+}_{2} \\
	\phi^{-}_{1} & \phi^{0}_{2}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

The multiplet interacted with the left and right-handed $SU(2)$ boson fields, and the Lagrangian $\Ell_{H2,LRS}$ that 
describes\footnote{$\Ell_{H2,LRS}$ is similar to $\Ell_{H}$ described in the previous section, but with extra terms for the second Higgs doublet} these 
interactions included a potential $V(\phi_{1},\phi_{2})$ that forced $\Phi$ to a non-zero expectation value.  When $V(\phi_{1},\phi_{2})$ was 
minimized in the early universe, the multiplet $\Phi$ took the value:

\begin{align}
	<\Phi> &= \begin{bmatrix}
	\nu_{1} & 0 \\
	0 & \nu_{2}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\label{eq:stageTwoVEV}
\end{align}

and the \WR, $Z'$, SM $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ acquired masses:

\begin{equation}
	m_{W_{L}} = \frac{1}{2}g\nu ,\quad m_{W_{R}} \simeq \frac{1}{2}gU_{R} ,\quad m_{Z} = \frac{1}{2}\bar{g}\nu ,\quad m_{Z'} \simeq \frac{1}{2}\bar{g}U_{R}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\nu^{2} \equiv \nu^{2}_{1} + \nu^{2}_{2} , \bar{g}^{2} \equiv g^{2} + g'^{2}
\end{equation}

where it was assumed that $U_{R} \gg \nu$, and there was negligible mixing between left and right-handed leptons, 
which is discussed later.  Thus, LRS models predicted the existence of the SM weak bosons with correct masses, and three new, 
heavier bosons.  The mass splitting between the left-handed SM $W,Z$ and right-handed $\WR,Z'$ provided clear evidence of 
parity violation in LRS models, whereas it was assumed in the SM without a clear theoretical source.

The addition of the $SU(2)_{R}$ group to the SM also introduced three new right-handed neutrinos $N^{l}_{R}$.  
LRS models considered here postulated that neutrino masses came from a mixture of Dirac and Majorana mass 
terms \cite{seeSawAndParityViolation,seeSawAndGUTs} described by the Lagrangian:

\begin{align}
	\Ell &= \frac{1}{2}(\bar{\nu}_{Li} \quad \bar{\nu}_{Ri})\begin{bmatrix}
	B'_{i} & M_{i} \\
	M_{i} & B_{i}
\end{bmatrix}(\nu_{Li} \quad \nu_{Ri})^{T}
\label{eq:nuMasses}
\end{align}

where $i$ was the lepton generation, and $\nu_{L}$ and $\nu_{R}$ were the massive, pure left and right-handed 
neutrino fermion fields.  The nonzero value of $<\Phi>$ in equation \ref{eq:stageTwoVEV} created the 
Dirac masses $M_{i}$, and the expectation values of $\chi_{L}$ and $\chi_{R}$ defined in equation \ref{eq:stageOneVEV} 
created the Majorana masses $B'_{i}$ and $B_{i}$.  As a result, $M_{i} \sim \nu$, $B'_{i} \sim 0$, 
$B_{i} \sim U_{R}$, and $B_{i} \gg M_{i}$, consistent with $m_{W_{R}} \gg m_{W_{L}}$.  Substituting 
$\nu,U_{R}$ for the Dirac and Majorana masses, equation \ref{eq:nuMasses} was diagonalized and 
yielded the following mass eigenvalues, assuming negligible left-right mixing:

\begin{equation}
	\lambda_{i+} \simeq B_{i},  \quad \lambda_{i-} \simeq -\frac{M^{2}_{i}}{B_{i}}
\end{equation}

The detectable states $N_{i}, \nu_{i}$ that participated in weak interactions were described in terms of 
the pure left and right-handed neutrino fields as:

\begin{equation}
	\nu_{i} \simeq \frac{1}{\sqrt{M^{2}_{i} + B^{2}_{i}}}(B_{i}\nu_{Li} - M_{i}\nu_{Ri}) \simeq \nu_{Li} - \frac{M_{i}}{B_{i}}\nu_{Ri} , \quad m_{\nu_{i}} = \lambda_{i-}
	
	N_{i} \simeq \frac{1}{\sqrt{M^{2}_{i} + B^{2}_{i}}}(M_{i}\nu_{Li} + B_{i}\nu_{Ri}) \simeq \nu_{Ri} + \frac{M_{i}}{B_{i}}\nu_{Li} , \quad m_{N_{i}} = \lambda_{i+}
\end{equation}

Thus, in LRS models, left-handed neutrinos $\nu_{i}$ were very light,  right-handed neutrinos $N_{i}$ were very 
heavy, and the left-handed neutrinos became lighter as the right-handed neutrinos became heavier.  Furthermore, 
mixing between left and right-handed states was highly suppressed by $\sim \frac{M_{i}}{B_{i}}$, which was 
supported by experimental evidence \cite{dZeroMixingLimits,theoreticalMixingLimits}.

In addition to explaining the source of neutrino masses and parity violation in the SM weak interaction, 
LRS models also predicted greater CP violation needed to explain the observed baryon asymmetry.  
Theoretical predictions of baryon asymmetry \cite{saharov} were supported by experimental evidence of CP violation, 
but the amount of CP violation predicted by the SM was insufficient to explain the observed baryon asymmetry \cite{surveyOfExtensions}.  
In the SM, CP violation only occured in weak interactions between quarks mediated by the $W^{\pm}$ boson.  
In LRS models the CP violating quark-quark interactions were mediated by the \WR and SM $W^{\pm}$, and the 
additional \WR mediator provided greater CP violation needed to explain the observed baryon asymmetry.


\section{LRS Model Phenomenology}
\label{sec:lrsPhenomenology}
in this section make a stronger connection to the lljj final state

The LRS models considered here retained all aspects of the SM that were supported by experimental 
evidence, and provided explanations for massive neutrinos, parity violation, and baryon asymmetry.  
In this thesis, the following assumptions were made that significantly affected the experimental 
detection of new particles predicted by LRS models:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The SM quarks and right-handed leptons had the same coupling strengths with the \WR and $Z'$ 
		as the SM quarks and left-handed leptons had with the SM $W$ and $Z$.
	\item $\frac{m_{\WR}}{m_{Z'}} \simeq \frac{m_{W}}{m_{Z}}$, so the \WR was lighter than the $Z'$.
	\item The right-handed neutrino \nul was lighter than the \WR.
\end{itemize}

Using proton-proton (pp) collisions delivered by the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and recorded 
by the CMS experiment, evidence of LRS models could be sought in several ways.  The $W_{R}$ and $Z'$ 
bosons coupled to quarks found inside the proton, so they 
could be produced in pp collisions.  As the lighter boson was more likely to be 
produced in LHC collisions, presented here is a search for the \WR, which is expected to be heavier than 
$m_{W_{R}} \gtrsim$ 2.8 TeV \cite{cmsWRRunOneResults}.

Analogous to the SM $W$ boson decay modes, LRS models predicted that the \WR 
decayed to a pair of quarks, or a right-handed charged lepton and heavy \nul.  The $\WR \rightarrow q_{1}q_{2}$ 
process had the highest cross section times branching fraction, but did not allow the mass 
\mnul to be measured, and the \WR signal was obscured by the large rate of high energy SM hadronic 
backgrounds encountered in pp collisions.  Instead, this thesis sought evidence of LRS models using 
the $\WR \rightarrow l\nul$ decay channel, where hadronic backgrounds were lower, and \mnul measurements 
were possible.  In this channel, the \nul decayed to a second charged 
lepton and a virtual $W^{*}_{R}$, or to a virtual $Z'^{*}$ and a virtual \nul.  To 
be consistent with experimental observations, it was assumed that the heavy neutrino decay to a charged lepton and 
virtual $W^{*}_{R}$ could not violate lepton flavor conservation, like $N_{\mu} \rightarrow eW^{*}_{R}$.  
Considering the two \nul decay modes, any \nul decay via $Z'^{*}N^{*}_{l}$ to detectable quarks or 
charged leptons was suppressed by the weak coupling constant squared, $g^{2}$, relative to 
the decay $\nul \rightarrow l^{\pm}W^{*}_{R} \rightarrow l^{\pm}q_{1}q_{2}$.  To maximize 
the probability of finding evidence of LRS models, this thesis presents a search 
for the \WR and \nul in the decay mode $\WR \rightarrow l_{1}\thickspace \nul \rightarrow 
l_{1}\thickspace l_{2}\thickspace q_{1}\thickspace q_{2}$ shown in Figure \ref{fig:wrFeynmanDiagram}.
