\section{Particles and Interaction Mediators}
The Standard Model of particle physics (SM) postulates that the universe can be reduced down to a small 
number of particles and interactions between them.  During the past four decades the SM has successfully 
explained many phenomena observed in physics and astronomy, and predicted the existence of many particles 
which were confirmed by experiments.

The theory that underpins the SM was proposed by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam in 1967 \cite{weinbergSM,salamSM}.  
In the theory, the fundamental building blocks of matter are organized into three generations.  Each 
generation has two quarks, a charged lepton paired with a neutral lepton, and particle and anti-particle 
versions of all four.  The human body and every material or substance that humans are able to sense are 
built from the first generation of particles, which consists of the electron, electron neutrino, and 
the up and down quark.  The second generation contains the muon and muon neutrino, and the charm and 
strange quark, while the third generation contains the tau and tau neutrino, and the top and bottom 
quark.

Interactions in the SM are split into three categories, and are mediated by additional particles.  The 
strong nuclear interaction occurs between quarks and is mediated by gluons.  The strong nuclear interaction 
counteracts the electromagnetic repulsion of same sign charged particles to bind protons and neutrons 
into nuclei.  The electromagnetic interaction occurs between all charged particles and is mediated by 
photons.  Negatively charged electrons are bound to positively charged nuclei by the electromagnetic 
interaction.  The weak nuclear interaction occurs between all particles in all generations, and is 
mediated by the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^{0}$ bosons.  The weak nuclear interaction causes the neutron to 
decay $n^{0} \rightarrow p^{+} + e^{-} + \bar{\nu_{e}} + heat$, which is used by nuclear power plants to 
generate electricity.

The interaction mediators gain mass through the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism.  This mechanism 
introduces four degrees of freedom to the SM in the form of a complex doublet with four complex fields 
representing scalar particles.

Neutrinos play a special role in the SM.  The SM postulates that they are massless, and thus cannot decay 
to other particles.  In addition, they only interact with matter through the weak interaction.  Neutrino
