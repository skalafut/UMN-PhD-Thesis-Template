Experimental evidence of neutrino oscillations motivates extensions to the ST.  Neutrino flavor oscillations have 
been observed by experiments \cite{kamiokandeTwo,solarNuSummary,NOvAresults,mainzPhaseIIResults,t2kResults,dayaBayResults}, 
and these observations imply that neutrinos have mass.  Neutrinos in the ST are only produced in left-handed 
states, so an extension, like the LRS model, with massive neutrinos is needed for a Lorentz invariant theory.

In this chapter, particle mass generation is discussed as a precursor to ST extensions; 
then, the Majorana neutrino model and the LRS model are explained, highlighting how these extensions 
show better agreement with experimental observations than the ST.  In conclusion, 
important characteristics of the LRS model that can be studied at the LHC are presented.


\section{Particle Masses in the Standard Theory}
\label{sec:massInSM}
In the ST the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism transforms the four $SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)$ group 
generators into the electroweak interaction mediators.  The BEH mechanism 
introduces a complex doublet $\Phi$, representing four scalar bosons, that obey the Lagrangian $\Ell_{H}$:

\begin{align}
	\Phi &= \begin{bmatrix}
	\phi^{+} \\
	\phi^{0}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
	\Ell_{H} = (D_{\mu}\Phi)^{\dagger}D^{\mu}\Phi - V(\Phi); \quad V(\Phi) = \frac{1}{2}(|\Phi|^{2} - \frac{\nu^{2}}{2})
\end{equation}
where $V(\Phi)$ is the Higgs potential (Figure \ref{fig:smHiggsPotential}), and 
$D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + ig_{L}\tau^{j}A^{j}_{\mu} + i\frac{g'}{2}YB_{\mu}$ represents the propagation 
of the Higgs doublet $\Phi$, and its couplings to the $SU(2)_{L}$ and $U(1)$ generators $\tau^{j}$ and $Y$ 
and the massless vector fields $A^{j}_{\mu}$ and $B_{\mu}$.  $g_{L}$ and 
$g'$ set the weak and electromagnetic interaction coupling strengths.  The Higgs doublet $\Phi$ naturally 
adopts a value $<\Phi> =$ (0   $\frac{\nu}{\sqrt{2}}$) that minimizes the Higgs potential, after which $\Ell_{H}$ 
reduces to Equation \ref{eq:stWeakBosonMassLagrangian}:

\begin{equation}
	\Ell_{HK} = \frac{\nu^{2}}{8}[g^{2}_{L}(A^{1}_{\mu} + iA^{2}_{\mu})(A^{1\mu} - iA^{2\mu}) + (g'B_{\mu} - g_{L}A^{3}_{\mu})^{2}]
	\label{eq:stWeakBosonMassLagrangian}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{The Higgs potential drives the ST Higgs field to a stable state with non-zero vacuum expectation value, from $The\thickspace Swiss \thickspace Physical\thickspace Society$ \cite{higgsPotential}.}
	\label{fig:smHiggsPotential}
\end{figure}

Defining the photon vector field $A_{\mu}$, and the weak boson vector fields $W^{\pm}_{\mu}$ and $Z_{\mu}$ as:

\begin{equation}
	W^{\pm}_{\mu} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(A^{1}_{\mu} \pm iA^{2}_{\mu}), 
	Z_{\mu} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{g'^{2} + g^{2}_{L}}}(g'B_{\mu} - g_{L}A^{3}_{\mu}), 
	A_{\mu} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{g'^{2} + g^{2}_{L}}}(g_{L}B_{\mu} + g'A^{3}_{\mu})
\end{equation}
transforms $\Ell_{HK}$ (Equation \ref{eq:stWeakBosonMassLagrangian}) into:

\begin{equation}
	\Ell_{HK} = (\frac{\nu g_{L}}{2})^{2}W^{+}_{\mu}W^{-\mu} + \frac{1}{2}(\frac{\nu \bar{g}}{2})^{2}Z_{\mu}Z^{\mu} + 0A_{\mu}A^{\mu}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{g} \equiv \sqrt{g'^{2} + g^{2}_{L}}$.  Following from this Lagrangian, the photon $A_{\mu}$ is massless, 
the $Z$ boson has mass $m_{Z} = \nu\bar{g}/2$, and the $W^{\pm}$ bosons have mass $m_{W} = \nu g_{L}/2$.  
Three of the four scalar fields introduced by the BEH mechanism are consumed to give mass to the $Z$ 
and $W^{\pm}$ bosons.  The fourth scalar field manifests as a scalar boson, the Higgs boson, and couples to all 
massive particles with a coupling strength proportional to the particle's mass.  The observation 
of the Higgs boson \cite{combinedHiggsResult} supports the ST prediction that the $Z$ and $W^{\pm}$ bosons acquire 
mass through the BEH mechanism.

In the ST, fermions acquire mass by adding more scalar Higgs fields to the 
BEH mechanism.  Additional Higgs fields add mass terms of the form $-mf\bar{f}$, where $f$ is a fermion, to 
the Lagrangian.  In the basis where a fermion field $f$ consists of right- and left-handed components $\chi_{R}$ 
and $\chi_{L}$, $f = (\chi_{L},\chi_{R})$, a fermion mass term in the Lagrangian is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
	\Ell_{D} = -m\bar{f}f = -m\chi^{\dagger}_{L}\chi_{R} - m\chi^{\dagger}_{R}\chi_{L}
	\label{eq:diracMass}
\end{equation}
This type of mass term, called a Dirac mass, contains the product of left- and right-handed fields.  Experimentally, 
quarks and charged leptons exist in left and right-handed states that are degenerate 
in mass, so Dirac mass terms are used to give mass to the fermions in the ST.

Neutrinos play a special role in the ST.  They are neutral, massless fermions, that only interact 
through the weak interaction.  In addition, due to parity violation in the weak interaction, 
anti-neutrinos are always right-handed, and neutrinos are always left-handed.  In the ST mass can only be 
assigned to a fermion through a Dirac mass term (Equation \ref{eq:diracMass}), which depends on the 
product of left- and right-handed fields.  The Dirac mass term for a neutrino yields a mass of zero, so an 
extension is required to account for the experimental observation of massive neutrinos.


\section{Standard Theory Extensions}
\label{sec:lrsExtensions}
There are several ways that the ST can be extended to accommodate massive, fermionic neutrinos.  In one of the 
simplest extensions neutrinos are Majorana fermions, which are their own anti-particles, and have masses 
$m_{L}$ and $m_{R}$ defined in the Lagrangian $\Ell_{M}$:

\begin{equation}
	\Ell_{M} = -m_{L}\chi^{\dagger}_{L}\chi_{L} - m_{R}\chi^{\dagger}_{R}\chi_{R}
\end{equation}
The two Majorana masses are generated through an extended Higgs model.  A consequence of Majorana neutrinos is that 
neutrinoless double beta decays could occur.  This has not yet been observed \cite{igexDblBetaDecay,gerdaDblBetaDecay}, 
leading to the exploration of alternate ideas.

One alternative is the Left-Right Symmetric (LRS) model, which predicts massive fermionic neutrinos that have not 
yet been observed in experiments.
First proposed in 1974 \cite{earlyLRSModel}, the LRS model predicts an electroweak 
interaction existed in the very early universe that conserved parity and was mediated by seven massless 
gauge bosons.  An extension of the ST BEH mechanism transformed the seven massless gauge bosons 
into the ST electroweak bosons, and the heavier $W^{\pm}_{R}$ (\WR) and $Z'$ bosons.

In the LRS model an $SU(2)_{R}$ group is added to the ST electroweak $SU(2)_{L} \times U(1)$ groups.
This introduces three massless vector fields $\xi^{j}_{R\mu}$, which become massive 
bosons through an extended BEH mechanism.  The mechanism is extended in two stages, and 
ultimately yields one massless and six massive gauge bosons that mediate the electroweak interactions.  
In the first stage \cite{lrsHiggsStageOne}, a chiral, complex Higgs doublet $\chi_{L,R}$ is introduced: 

\begin{align}
	\chi_{L,R} &= \begin{bmatrix}
	\chi^{+}_{L,R} \\
	\chi^{0}_{L,R}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\label{eq:stageOneVEV}
\end{align}
with bosonic fields that couple independently to the left- and right-handed gauge bosons.  The propagation and 
interaction of these new fields with other massless bosons is described by the Lagrangian:

\begin{equation}
	\Ell_{H,LRS} = \frac{1}{2}(D_{\mu}\chi_{L})^{\dagger}D^{\mu}\chi_{L} + \frac{1}{2}(D_{\mu}\chi_{R})^{\dagger}D^{\mu}\chi_{R} - V(\chi_{L,R})
	\label{eq:stageOneHiggsLrs}
\end{equation}
where $D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + ig_{L}\tau^{j}A^{j}_{L\mu} + ig_{R}\tau^{j}\xi^{j}_{R\mu} + i\frac{g'}{2}YB_{\mu}$ contains 
the massless boson fields $A^{j}_{L\mu}, \xi^{j}_{R\mu}, B_{\mu}$ multiplied by the generators of the $SU(2)_{L}, SU(2)_{R}, U(1)$ groups.  
In the LRS model considered here the coupling strengths $g_{R}, g_{L}$ were assumed to be equal, and are denoted as $g$.  
The potential $V(\chi_{L,R})$ respects the LRS model symmetries, and depends on a constant $U_{R}$.  $\chi_{L,R}$ 
equilibrates at $<\chi^{+}_{L,R}> = 0, <\chi^{0}_{L}> = 0, <\chi^{0}_{R}> = U_{R}$ to minimize $V(\chi_{L,R})$, 
and subsequently creates new fields:

\begin{equation}
	W^{\pm}_{R\mu} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\xi^{1}_{R\mu} \mp i\xi^{2}_{R\mu}); \quad 
	Z'_{\mu} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{g'^{2} + g^{2}}}(-g'B_{\mu} + g\xi^{3}_{R\mu})
\end{equation}
that have masses:

\begin{equation}
	\mWR = \frac{1}{2}gU_{R}  \quad m_{Z'} = \frac{1}{2}U_{R}\sqrt{g'^{2} + g^{2}}
\end{equation}
After the first stage, the $\WR$ and $Z'$ bosons are predicted to have masses $\mWR = \frac{1}{2}gU_{R}$ and 
$m_{Z'} = \frac{1}{2}U_{R}\sqrt{g'^{2} + g^{2}}$, and all other bosons remain massless.

In the second stage \cite{lrsHiggsStageOne,lrsHiggsStageTwo}, two complex Higgs doublets $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$ 
are introduced through a multiplet $\Phi$:

\begin{align}
	\Phi &= \begin{bmatrix}
	\phi^{0}_{1} & \phi^{+}_{2} \\
	\phi^{-}_{1} & \phi^{0}_{2}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
This multiplet interacts with the left- and right-handed $SU(2)$ boson fields, and these interactions are described by a 
Lagrangian $\Ell_{H2,LRS}$ similar to Equation \ref{eq:stageOneHiggsLrs} but with additional terms for the second Higgs doublet.  
Within $\Ell_{H2,LRS}$ is a potential $V(\phi_{1},\phi_{2})$, and $\Phi$ naturally adopts a non-zero expectation 
value that minimizes $V(\phi_{1},\phi_{2})$:

\begin{align}
	<\Phi> &= \begin{bmatrix}
	\nu_{1} & 0 \\
	0 & \nu_{2}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\label{eq:stageTwoVEV}
\end{align}
At equilibrium, the \WR, $Z'$, and the ST $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons have masses:

\begin{equation}
	m_{W} = \frac{1}{2}g\nu ,\quad m_{W_{R}} \simeq \frac{1}{2}gU_{R} ,\quad m_{Z} = \frac{1}{2}\bar{g}\nu ,\quad m_{Z'} \simeq \frac{1}{2}\bar{g}U_{R}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\nu^{2} \equiv \nu^{2}_{1} + \nu^{2}_{2} , \quad \bar{g}^{2} \equiv g^{2} + g'^{2}
\end{equation}
It is assumed that $U_{R} \gg \nu$, and there is negligible mixing between the left and right-handed leptons.  
Thus, the LRS model predicts the correct masses for the ST weak bosons, and masses for three new, heavier bosons.  
The mass difference between the left-handed $W^{\pm},Z$ and the right-handed $\WR,Z'$ is an indication of parity 
violation in the LRS model, as compared with the ST where parity violation does not have a clear theoretical motivation.  
In the fermionic sector, the LRS model predicts new neutrinos with masses consistent with neutrino flavor oscillations.

With the addition of the $SU(2)_{R}$ group, three new right-handed neutrinos $N^{l}_{R}$ (\nul) arise naturally 
to form doublets of $SU(2)_{R}$ hypercharge with right-handed charged leptons.  The LRS model 
predicts non-zero masses for \nul and ST neutrinos using a mixture of Dirac and Majorana mass terms \cite{seeSawAndParityViolation,seeSawAndGUTs}:

\begin{align}
	\Ell &= \frac{1}{2}(\bar{\nu}_{Li} \quad \bar{\nu}_{Ri})\begin{bmatrix}
	B'_{i} & M_{i} \\
	M_{i} & B_{i}
\end{bmatrix}(\nu_{Li} \quad \nu_{Ri})^{T}
\label{eq:nuMasses}
\end{align}
where $i$ is the lepton generation, and $\nu_{L}$ and $\nu_{R}$ are massive, pure left and right-handed 
fermionic neutrino fields.  The nonzero value of $<\Phi>$ in Equation \ref{eq:stageTwoVEV} leads to the 
Dirac masses $M_{i}$, and the expectation values of $\chi_{L}$ and $\chi_{R}$ defined in Equation \ref{eq:stageOneVEV} 
lead to the Majorana masses $B'_{i}$ and $B_{i}$.  As a result, $M_{i} \sim \nu$, $B'_{i} \sim 0$, 
$B_{i} \sim U_{R}$, and $B_{i} \gg M_{i}$, which is consistent with $m_{W_{R}} \gg m_{W}$.  Substituting 
$\nu$ and $U_{R}$ for the Dirac and Majorana masses, Equation \ref{eq:nuMasses} is diagonalized and yields 
the following neutrino mass eigenvalues, assuming negligible left-right mixing:

\begin{equation}
	\lambda_{i+} \simeq B_{i},  \quad \lambda_{i-} \simeq \frac{M^{2}_{i}}{B_{i}}
\end{equation}
The detectable states $N_{i}$ and $\nu_{i}$ that participate in electroweak interactions are mixtures of the pure 
left- and right-handed neutrino fields:

\begin{equation}
	\nu_{i} \simeq \frac{1}{\sqrt{M^{2}_{i} + B^{2}_{i}}}(B_{i}\nu_{Li} - M_{i}\nu_{Ri}) \simeq \nu_{Li} - \frac{M_{i}}{B_{i}}\nu_{Ri}
	
	N_{i} \simeq \frac{1}{\sqrt{M^{2}_{i} + B^{2}_{i}}}(M_{i}\nu_{Li} + B_{i}\nu_{Ri}) \simeq \nu_{Ri} + \frac{M_{i}}{B_{i}}\nu_{Li}

\end{equation}
that have masses:

\begin{equation}
	m_{\nu_{i}} = \lambda_{i-} \simeq \frac{M^{2}_{i}}{B_{i}} , \quad m_{N_{i}} = \lambda_{i+} \simeq B_{i}
\end{equation}
Thus, the LRS model predicts the left-handed neutrinos $\nu_{i}$ have masses $\lambda_{i-} \simeq M_{i}\frac{M_{i}}{B_{i}}$, 
and the right-handed neutrinos $N_{i}$ have masses $\lambda_{i+} \simeq B_{i} \gg M_{i}$.  Appropriate choices 
for $M_{i}$ and $B_{i}$ yields very light left-handed neutrinos, very heavy right-handed neutrinos, 
and negligible mixing between left- and right-handed states (suppressed by $\sim \frac{M_{i}}{B_{i}} \ll 1$), 
which is consistent with the experimental evidence \cite{dZeroMixingLimits,theoreticalMixingLimits}.

In addition to predicting massive neutrinos and parity violation in the weak interaction, the LRS model, through \WR and 
$Z'$ mediated interactions, predicts more CP violation than the ST \cite{surveyOfExtensions}.  Hence, the LRS model 
predicts an asymmetry between the number of baryons and anti-baryons that is closer to observations.


\section{LRS Model Phenomenology}
\label{sec:lrsPhenomenology}
The LRS model discussed thus far retains all the aspects of the ST, and predicts 
massive neutrinos, parity violation in a natural way, and the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the universe.  
Specific realizations of the LRS model retain these features, and are distinguished by unique values of 
several free parameters: the weak coupling constant $g_{R}$, the left-right symmetric energy scale $U_{R}$ 
that sets the \WR mass, the masses $B_{i}$ and $M_{i}$ that set the \nul and ST $\nu$ masses, and the three 
mixing angles $\theta_{i}$ and the CP violating phase $\delta_{R}^{CP}$ that define the \WR analogue 
of the CKM quark mixing matrix.  As stated earlier, in this thesis the coupling $g_{R}$ is assumed to be 
the same for all lepton flavors and equal to the ST weak coupling $g_{L}$.  Both the \WR and \nul masses 
are constrained by unitarity to be $< \sim10^{6.5}$ $\GeV$ \cite{lrsMassConstraints}.  Furthermore, the \WR is 
excluded at 95\% CL for $\mWR < 2.5$ $\TeV$ based on the measured neutral kaon $K_{L} - K_{S}$ mass difference 
\cite{mwrBoundFromNeutralKaons}.  The \nul mass (\mnul) can be above or below \mWR, but as \mnul decreases 
both the rate of mixing between the \nul and ST $\nu$, and the left-handed component of \nul increase.  The 
larger left-handed component of \nul increases the rate of $\nul \rightarrow W^{\pm}\ell^{\mp}$.  If \mnul is 
close to the $Z$ boson mass, energetic ST neutrinos from $Z \rightarrow \nu\nu$ decays could mix into \nul 
states, and produce a charged lepton through $pp \rightarrow Z \rightarrow \nu\nu \rightarrow \nu\nul \rightarrow \nu W^{\pm}\ell^{\mp}$.  
Measurements that are sensitive to the $Z \rightarrow \nu\nu$ rate \cite{gammaZinvisResult,higgsInvisResultsRunIandII} 
have not seen any deviations from ST predictions, so it is expected that $\mnul \gtrsim 90$ $\GeV$.

Not all realizations of the LRS model can be tested at the LHC.  However, at LHC energies there are some 
specific LRS model realizations that can be tested, if the following assumptions are made:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The ST quarks and all right-handed leptons couple to the \WR and $Z'$ with the same strengths 
		as the ST quarks and all left-handed leptons couple to the ST weak bosons.  This constrains the 
		\WR analogue of the CKM matrix to match the ST CKM matrix.
	\item The right-handed neutrinos \nul are lighter than the \WR, and hence the \WR decays to the \nul.
	\item The decay of the \nul does not violate lepton flavor conservation, and hence only the processes 
		$\WR \rightarrow eN_{e} \rightarrow eeW^{*}_{R}$ and $\WR \rightarrow \mu N_{\mu} \rightarrow \mu\mu W^{*}_{R}$ are allowed.
\end{itemize}
Given these assumptions, the \WR and $Z'$ bosons can be produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions delivered by 
the LHC and recorded by the CMS experiment.  The lighter \WR is more likely than the $Z'$ to have a mass within 
the LHC's reach, so LRS model realizations were tested by searching for evidence of the \WR boson, where the \WR 
decays to a pair of quarks or a charged lepton $\ell$ and a heavy neutrino \nul.  The \WR decay to a quark pair 
has the highest branching fraction, but does not permit a \nul mass measurement.  The $\WR \rightarrow \ell\nul$ 
decay permits a measurement of the neutrino mass \mnul, and this decay is the subject of this thesis.


\section{Experimental Signature}
\label{sec:lrsExpSignature}
In the $\WR \rightarrow l_{1}\nul$ decay, the \nul decays to a virtual $Z'*$ and $\nul^{*}$, or a second 
charged lepton $l_{2}$ and a virtual $\WR^{*}$.  The \nul decay to a charged lepton and two quarks through a 
virtual $\WR^{*}$, $\nul \rightarrow l_{2}\WR^{*} \rightarrow l_{2}q_{1}q_{2}$, has the highest branching fraction 
and provides good \mnul resolution because the energies of $l_{2}q_{1}q_{2}$ are measured with good resolution. 
Therefore, the \nul was searched for in the $\nul \rightarrow l_{2}q_{1}q_{2}$ decay mode.  The production 
and decay of a \WR and \nul,$pp \rightarrow \WR \rightarrow l_{1}\nul \rightarrow l_{1}l_{2}q_{1}q_{2}$ ($l_{1}l_{2} = ee,\mu\mu$), 
is expected to produce events with two same flavor leptons and two quarks that hadronize into two jets, as shown 
in Figure \ref{fig:wrFeynmanDiagram}.  Based on prior searches \cite{cmsWRRunOneResults} the \WR is expected to 
be heavier than 2 $\TeV$, so its decay produces high energy leptons and jets.  By measuring the energies and 
trajectories of the leptons and jets, the dilepton $\plus$ dijet ($\Mlljj$) and lepton $\plus$ dijet ($\Mljj$) 
invariant masses are calculated, from which the \WR and \nul masses are extracted: $\mWR = \Mlljj$, $\mnul = \Mljj$.  
Multiple CMS sub-detectors described in the next chapter are used to measure the energies and trajectories of 
leptons and jets produced in proton-proton collisions.
