a. the spring constant is $\frac{mg}{x_{0}}$\newline

the spring force k$x_{0}$ is equal to the weight of the object\newline
when the mass is at the equilibrium position $x_{0}$\newline
net force at equilibrium $= 0 = kx_{0} - mg$\newline
$k = \frac{mg}{x_{0}}$\newline

b.$v = \sqrt{\frac{2(-mgx - 0.5kx^{2})}{m}}$ \newline
x = drop distance = $0$ initially, negative when the mass\newline
is below the drop point\newline
initial system energy = 0 because spring is not stretched\newline
so total energy = 0 = $0.5mv^{2} + mgx + 0.5kx^{2}$\newline
$v = \sqrt{\frac{2(-mgx - 0.5kx^{2})}{m}}$

c. max elongation is $2x_{0}$\newline

when the spring is at its maximum length the mass is\newline
at rest, so the spring and gravitational potential\newline
energies satisfy\newline
0 = $-mgx_{m} + 0.5kx_{m}^{2}$\newline
$x_{m}$ = max stretch = $\frac{2mg}{k} \rightarrow 2x_{0}$\newline
                                                                          
d. the spring is not stretched when the mass is first\newline
released, so the maximum height of the mass will be\newline
its initial position.
