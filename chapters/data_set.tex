a. the spring constant is (mass m)$(153 \frac{N}{m kg})$\newline

the spring force k$y_{0}$ is equal to the weight of the object\newline
when the mass is at the equilibrium position $y_{0}$\newline
$y_{0} = 6.4$ cm\newline
net force at equilibrium $= 0 = ky_{0} - mg$\newline
$k = \frac{mg}{y_{0}}$\newline

b.$v = \sqrt{\frac{2(-mgy - 0.5ky^{2})}{m}}$ \newline
y = drop distance = $0$ initially, negative when the mass\newline
is below the drop point\newline
initial system energy = 0 because spring is not stretched\newline
so total energy = 0 = $0.5mv^{2} + mgy + 0.5ky^{2}$\newline
                                                      
c. max elongation is $13$ cm\newline

when the spring is at its maximum length the mass is\newline
at rest, so the spring and gravitational potential\newline
energies satisfy\newline
0 = $-mgy_{m} + 0.5ky_{m}^{2}$\newline
$y_{m}$ = max stretch = $\frac{2mg}{k} \rightarrow 2y_{0}$\newline
                                                                          
d. the spring is not stretched when the mass is first\newline
released, so the maximum height of the mass will be\newline
its initial position.
