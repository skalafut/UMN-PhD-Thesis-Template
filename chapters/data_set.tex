a. the velocity is $13. \frac{m}{s}$ downward, the momentum is $13000 \frac{kg m}{s}$ downward
   the kinetic energy is $78000$ Joules, and the acceleration is $9.8 \frac{m}{s^{2}}$ downward
                           
initial elevator velocity $v_{0}$ = $0 \frac{m}{s}$
downward velocity $v_{8f}$ after $x_{8e} = 8.0$ meter fall is
$v_{8f}^{2} = 2gx_{8e} \rightarrow v_{8f} = 12.5 \frac{m}{s}$
                                      
acceleration comes from gravity, so acceleration magnitude is $9.8 \frac{m}{s^{2}$
                                     
momentum magnitude and kinetic energy are calculated using $v_{8f}$
kinetic energy = (1/2)$m_{elev}v_{8f}^{2} = 78400$ Joules
momentum magnitude = $m_{elev}v_{8f} = 12528 \frac{kg m}{s}$
                                                      
b. spring constant = $180000 \frac{N}{m}$
                                                      
the spring constant can be obtained in two equivalent ways using energy conservation.
The spring absorbs all the kinetic energy of the elevator, obtained from part a, plus
the gravitational potential energy which the elevator has when it sits $1.0$ meter
above the point where it comes to rest.
                                            
Equivalently, the spring absorbs all of the potential energy which the elevator has
when it sits $9.0$ meters above the point where it comes to rest (where the spring
has compressed $\Delta x_{s} = 1.0$ meter).
                                                                  
Equating the potential energy of the compressed spring with spring constant k to the 
elevator total energy yields

(1/2)k$\Delta x_{s}^{2}$ = $m_{elev}g(9.0 meters)$                
or                                                   
(1/2)k$\Delta x_{s}^{2}$ = (1/2)$m_{elev}v_{8f}^{2}$ + $m_{elev}g(1.0 meter)$
                                                    
yields k = $176400 \frac{N}{m}$
                                                       
c. when the elevator stops moving the net force = $170000$ Newtons upward   net accel = $170 \frac{m}{s^{2}}$ upward
                                                    
magnitude of the net force $F_{net}$ = spring force - elevator weight
$F_{net}$ = k$\Delta x_{s}$ - $m_{elev}g = 166590$ Newtons         
net acceleration magnitude = $\frac{F_{net}}{m_{elev}} = 166.6 \frac{m}{s^{2}}$
                                                                           
d. when the elevator is $4.0$ meters above the spring its speed = $8.9 \frac{m}{s}$
                                                                      
no energy is lost or dissipated in the spring and elevator system, so the speed of the elevator when it is
moving up and is $4.0$ meters above the spring is equal to the speed of the elevator when it is moving down
and has fallen a height of $4.0$ meters.

$v_{4f}^{2}$ = $2g(4.0 meters)$
speed $v_{4f} = \sqrt{2g(4.0 meters)} = 8.86 \frac{m}{s}$
