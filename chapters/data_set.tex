b.the net torque at any point must be zero, and the net force in each direction must be zero \newline
m = mass of sign, h = length of one side on the sign\newline
for this problem to have a solution, it must be assumed that one connection is\newline
completely fixed (only a force in the x direction), and another connection\newline
allows both a vertical and horizontal force (like a pin).  Based\newline
on this, either $N_{y1}$ or $N_{y2}$ are zero.  Either approach\newline
is valid. Here it is assumed that the lower connection (where $N_{x1}$ and\newline
$N_{y1}$ act) is fixed, so $N_{y1} = 0$.\newline

net force in the x direction: $0 = N_{x2} - N_{x1}$\newline
net force in the y direction: $0 = N_{y2} - mg$\newline
net torque about point P: $0 = \frac{mgh}{2} - N_{x2}h$\newline

c. sign weight = 98. N in -y direction, $N_{x2} = 49.$ N in x direction\newline
$N_{x1} = 49.$ N in -x direction, $N_{y2} = 98.$ N in y direction\newline
about point P, the weight creates a torque of 20. Nm in the z direction\newline
about point P, the reaction force $N_{x2}$ creates a torque of 20. Nm in the -z direction\newline

sign mass m = 10.0 kg, g = 9.8 $\frac{m}{s^{2}}$, h = 0.40 meters\newline
solving the equations from part b yields\newline
torque about point P: $0 = \frac{mgh}{2} - N_{x2}h \rightarrow N_{x2} = \frac{mg}{2}$\newline
thus $N_{x1} = \frac{mg}{2}$ in -x direction\newline
net force in y direction $\rightarrow N_{y2} = mg$
