\chapter{Background Estimation}
\label{sec:backgroundEstimation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Data used in the $ee$- and $\mu\mu$-channel searches contained events produced by ST backgrounds.  
Applying the event selection described in Chapter \ref{sec:event_selection_chapter} to data reduced 
the number of background events found in the $\Mlljj$ distribution, but not to a negligible level.  
The magnitude and shape of the $\Mlljj$ distribution found in background events was estimated using 
procedures described here.


\section{Top Quark Background}
\label{sec:topQrkBkgnds}
One of the two largest backgrounds in the \WR and \nul search was ST processes that produced at least 
one top quark, like top quark $\plus$ $W$ boson production (top+W, Figure \ref{fig:singleTopDiags}), 
and top anti-top quark pair production ($\ttbar$, Figure \ref{fig:ttbarDiag}).  Top 
quarks decay to a $W$ boson and bottom (b) quark, which subsequently decay to leptons and hadrons.  
Based on lepton universality in $W$ boson and b quark decays, in events where one or more top (or anti-top) 
quarks are produced and decay to two leptons, the $e\mu$ final state is produced at twice 
the rate of the $ee$ or $\mu\mu$ final state.  The \WR cannot decay to the $e\mu$ final state at leading 
order in the weak coupling constant, so data events with one reconstructed electron and muon were used to 
estimate the shape and magnitude of the $\Memujj$ distribution from top quark backgrounds.  Normalization 
factors of $\sim 0.5$ were then applied to scale the $\Memujj$ distribution into the $\Meejj$ or $\Mmumujj$ 
distribution.

\end{figure}

Data events in the $e\mu$-channel were selected during collisions using a Level-1 trigger that required 
a track in at least one muon DT or CSC detector with $\pt > 16$ $\GeV$.  Events that passed the Level-1 selection 
were reconstructed if they passed the following electron and muon HLT selections:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A track reconstructed in the silicon tracker with $\pt > 30$ $\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$ was geometrically matched to 
		the muon detector hits that passed the L1 trigger.  Considering this set of muon detector hits and the matching 
		reconstructed track:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A curve representing the muon trajectory through CMS was fitted to the reconstructed track and at least one 
			muon detector hit with $\chi^{2}/nDOF < 20$.
		\item In the plane perpendicular to the beam axis, the distance between the reconstructed track origin and its 
			reconstructed vertex was $< 1$ mm.
	\end{itemize}
	\item One ECAL SC was detected with $\Et > 30$ $\GeV$.
	\item For the SC:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The ratio of hadronic energy in the HCAL tower behind the SC to the SC energy was $< 0.15$ in the barrel, and $< 0.1$ in the endcap.
		\item Ninety percent of the SC energy was measured in an $(\eta, \phi)$ region that is two crystals wide in $\eta$.
		\item For SCs in the barrel, a reconstructed track with hits in at least two pixel tracker layers extrapolated to the 
			SC centroid along the beam axis within 2.3 \cm, and extrapolated to the SC centroid in $(\eta_{SC}, \phi_{SC})$ within the 
			$(\eta, \phi)$ area of one ECAL crystal.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The reconstructed $e\mu$ data events were filtered by the electron, muon, and jet selections described 
previously, with the requirement that one selected lepton was a muon, the other was an electron, 
and at least one lepton had $\pt > 60$ $\GeV$.  Simulated ST background events were selected with the 
same online and offline requirements, and compared to $e\mu$-channel data events.  As shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:dataAndSimsInEMuChannel}, top quark backgrounds produced the majority of events that passed 
the $e\mu$-channel selections.

	\caption{The $\Mlljj$ distribution from data and simulated ST events that passed the $e\mu$ selection, excluding 
	the $\Mlljj > 600 \GeV$ cut.  The bin widths were variable, and their contents were normalized to the bin widths.}
	\label{fig:dataAndSimsInEMuChannel}
\end{figure}

%first explain that the Mlljj distribution shape does not change between the emu, ee, and mumu channels
The $\Memujj$ distribution found in data was produced by top quark backgrounds, so its shape was expected 
to be the same in the $\Meejj$ and $\Mmumujj$ distributions.  This expectation was studied using simulated 
top quark background events.  Simulated 
events were selected with the $ee$-, $e\mu$-, and $\mu\mu$-channel selections, and these events were used 
to produce $\Meejj$, $\Memujj$, and $\Mmumujj$ distributions.  The ratio of the binned distributions $\Meejj / \Memujj$ 
and $\Mmumujj / \Memujj$, shown in Figure \ref{fig:ttbarSFratios}, was consistent with a constant value, 
independent of $\Mlljj$, within the statistical uncertainty of each bin.  The constant ratios indicated that the 
shape of the $\Mlljj$ distribution in top quark background events was the same in all three lepton channels, 
which meant the $\Memujj$ distribution found in data could be used to estimate the top quark background in 
the $ee$- and $\mu\mu$-channel.

%then explain how scale factors were derived to rescale the magnitude of the Memujj distribution to the 
%Meejj and Mmumujj distributions based on the difference between electron and muon acceptances, and 
%efficiencies of the trigger, reco, and offline selections
The $\Memujj$ distribution found in data represented top quark backgrounds, and differed from the top quark 
$\Meejj$ and $\Mmumujj$ distributions by a normalization factor (NF) equal to the difference in several quantities.  
The difference between the $e\mu$ and the same flavor $\ell\ell$ production rate is 0.5, so the NF 
was expected to be $\approx$0.5.  Differences existed between the electron and muon acceptance $\times$ 
selection efficiency\footnote{For example, muons were reconstructed in the region $1.44 \leq |\eta| \leq 1.57$, 
while electrons were not.}, and they caused the $ee:e\mu$ and $\mu\mu:e\mu$ NFs to differ from 0.5.  
The normalization factors were calculated using simulated top quark events selected with the $ee$-, $e\mu$-, 
and $\mu\mu$-channel selections and corrections described previously.  Selected events were used to 
produce the $\Mlljj$ distribution in each channel, and the integral of each distribution $\Nlljj$ was 
calculated.  The NF that scales the simulated $\Memujj$ distribution into the $\Meejj$ 
distribution was calculated as $\Neejj / \Nemujj \thickspace = \thickspace 0.432$, and for the $\Mmumujj$ 
distribution was calculated as $\Nmumujj / \Nemujj \thickspace = \thickspace 0.659$.  The lower acceptance 
$\times$ selection efficiency for electrons relative to muons decreased (increased) the $ee:e\mu$ 
($\mu\mu:e\mu$) NF relative to 0.5.  The NFs were 
calculated independent of $\Mlljj$, but were dominated by simulated events with $\Mlljj < 1500$ $\GeV$ 
because the number of simulated top quark events decreased rapidly with increasing $\Mlljj$.  As a 
result, an error entered the top quark background estimate that was proportional to the per-bin 
fluctuations of $\Mmumujj / \Memujj$ and $\Meejj / \Memujj$ around the values 0.659 and 0.432 shown 
in Figure \ref{fig:ttbarSFratios}.  The impact of this error was covered by assigning a 10\% uncertainty 
to both NFs.

After calculating the NFs, the top quark background in the $\mu\mu jj$ ($eejj$) final state was estimated by 
multiplying the $\Memujj$ distribution from data by $0.659$ ($0.432$).  Based on simulations of all ST backgrounds, 
contributions of non-top quark backgrounds to the $e\mu$ channel were more than one order of magnitude smaller 
than the 10\% top quark background uncertainty.  For this reason, simulated non-top quark background events 
were not subtracted from $e\mu$ channel data.

\section{\DY Background}
\label{sec:dyBkgnd}
The second of the two largest backgrounds in the \WR and \nul search was the production and decay of a Z boson to 
a lepton pair in association with jets (\DY), $pp \rightarrow Z+jets \rightarrow \ell\ell+jets$.  The \DY 
background was estimated using simulated $\DY$+jets events selected with the $ee$- and $\mu\mu$-channel requirements 
described previously.  $\DY$+jets simulations were developed to model $\DY$+jets interactions observed in data, and 
mis-modelling in simulations lead to two discrepancies between $\DY$+jets simulations and data.

\subsection{\DY Normalization in $\Mlljj$}
\label{sec:dyNormInMlljj}
$\DY$+jets events were simulated using the \MADGRAPH generator at leading order in the electroweak and strong coupling 
constants, while $\DY$+jets events observed in data were produced at all orders in these coupling constants.  The 
simulated dataset contained more events than were expected in the 2.6 fb$^{-1}$ of data, so the simulated events were 
weighted to the integrated luminosity of data using an uncertain cross section $\times$ branching fraction calculated during 
simulations.  The cross section $\times$ branching fraction uncertainty was sensitive to the higher order electroweak 
and strong coupling corrections, and it created a discrepancy in the $\Mlljj$ distribution normalization between data 
and simulated events.

The magnitude of the normalization discrepancy in the $\Mlljj$ distribution was estimated 
using a $Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$ control region where data and simulated events were expected to agree.  Data and simulated 
$\DY$+jets events in the $ee$-channel control region were selected by a Level-1 trigger that required one ECAL SC with 
$\Et > 30$ $\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.1$.  Events that passed the Level-1 selection were used offline if they passed the 
following double electron HLT selections:

\begin{itemize}
	\item One SC was detected with $\Et > 30$ $\GeV$, and a second non-overlapping SC was detected with $\Et > 4$ $\GeV$.
	\item For the SC with $\Et > 30$ $\GeV$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The ratio of hadronic energy in the HCAL tower behind the SC to the SC energy was $< 0.055$ in the barrel, and 
			$< 0.07$ in the endcap.
		\item Ninety percent of the SC energy was measured in an $(\eta, \phi)$ region that was two crystals wide in $\eta$.
		\item A reconstructed track with hits in at least two pixel tracker layers was matched to the SC, and extrapolated to the SC 
			centroid along the beam axis within 1 cm, and extrapolated to the SC centroid in $(\eta, \phi)$ within the $(\eta, \phi)$ 
			area of $\frac{1}{2}$ an ECAL crystal.  In addition, the SC energy and track momentum cannot differ by more than 50\%.
		\item In a cone of radius $\Delta R =$ 0.3 centered on the SC:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The fraction of the total ECAL energy in the cone not associated with the SC was $< 0.225$ in the barrel, and 
				$< 0.121$ in the endcap.
			\item The total HCAL energy in the cone divided by the SC energy is $< 0.155$ in the barrel, and $< 0.16$ in the endcap.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Data and simulated events in the $\mu\mu$-channel control region were selected by a Level-1 trigger that required a track 
in at least one muon DT or CSC detector with $\pt > 20$ $\GeV$.  Events that passed the Level-1 selection were used offline 
if they passed the following single muon HLT selections:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A track reconstructed in the silicon tracker with $\pt > 22$ $\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$ was geometrically matched to 
		the muon detector hits that passed the L1 trigger.  Considering this set of muon detector hits and the matching reconstructed 
		track:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A curve representing the muon trajectory through CMS was fitted to the reconstructed track and at least 
			one muon detector hit with $\chi^{2}/nDOF < 20$.
		\item In the plane perpendicular to the beam axis, the distance between the reconstructed track origin and its 
			reconstructed vertex was $< 1$ mm.
		\item In a cone of radius $\Delta R =$ 0.3 centered on the muon trajectory:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The total ECAL energy in the cone divided by the momentum measured by the muon detectors is $< 0.11$ in 
				the barrel, and $< 0.08$ in the endcap.
			\item The total HCAL energy in the cone divided by the momentum measured by the muon detectors is $< 0.21$ in 
				the barrel, and $< 0.22$ in the endcap.
			\item The total $\pt$ of all silicon tracker tracks in the cone (excluding the muon track) divided by the 
				muon track $\pt$ is $< 0.09$.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Similar to the offline lepton and jet selections used in the \WR search and defined in Chapters \ref{sec:muonSelection}, \ref{sec:electronSelection}, 
and \ref{sec:jetSelection}, reconstructed events in both channels were required to have two leptons and two jets passing kinematic 
and ID selections.  However, looser lepton $\pt$ and $\Mll$ selections were used to select events in the $Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$ 
mass window.  The differences and similarities between the $Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$ control region and the \WR search selections 
are listed in Table \ref{tab:cutCompSignalRegAndZllReg}.

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Events in data and $\DY$+jets simulations passing the $Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$ selections were used to produce a $\Mll$ 
distribution.  In both lepton channels, the $\Mll$ distribution shape agreed between data and simulated events.  The 
normalization of the $\Mll$ distribution in data events exceeded that of simulated events by 15.7\% in the $ee$-channel, 
and 14.2\% in the $\mu\mu$-channel.  To correct this normalization discrepancy, the $\DY$ background predicted using 
simulated events was increased by $\sim$15\%.  The contamination of other ST backgrounds in selected data events was 
estimated using simulated background events selected with the requirements described above, and found to be $\sim$3\%.  
This was similar to the uncertainty on the $\sim$15\% correction discussed next, so other ST backgrounds were not subtracted 
from data.

Two additional simulated $\DY$+jets datasets were produced with different \MC generators, and used to estimate the uncertainty 
on the $\sim$15\% \DY background correction.  Events from data and all three simulated $\DY$+jets datasets were selected 
using the $Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$ selections without jet requirements.  The jet requirements were removed to compare data 
to simulations in a phase space where all three simulated datasets yielded a large number of events after selections.  Selected 
events were used to produce $\Mll$ distributions, and the difference in $\Mll$ normalization was calculated between data and each 
set of simulated events.  The largest difference was taken as the uncertainty on $\sim$15\%.  The uncertainty was 2.0\% in the 
$ee$-channel, and 1.0\% in the $\mu\mu$-channel.

\subsection{\DY Shape in $\Mlljj$}
\label{sec:dyShapeInMlljj}
In $\DY$+jets events from data or simulations, the Z production and decay was reconstructed as a vertex that was 
most often the primary vertex (PV), which was defined as the vertex with the highest $\sum \pt$ of all associated 
tracks in the event.  Selected reconstructed jets were required to have at least one charged hadron from the PV, and the partons 
radiated during the Z production and decay produced the majority of charged hadrons that traced back to the PV\footnote{The 
contamination of $Z \rightarrow \tau\tau$ in events with $ee$+jets or $\mu\mu$+jets final states was minimized by 
requiring two leptons with $\pt > 53$ $\GeV$.}.  $\DY$+jets events were simulated with up to 4 partons radiated from 
the $Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$ interaction, while $\DY$+jets events observed in data were produced with any number - 
0, 2, 6, etc. - of partons radiated from the $Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$ interaction.  The limit of 4 radiated partons 
in simulated events reduced the number of reconstructed jets that could pass the selections, and affected the energy 
of selected jets, as multiple partons could contribute to the same jet.  These jet modelling effects produced a discrepancy 
in the $\Mlljj$ distribution shape between data and simulated events.

The magnitude of the shape discrepancy in the $\Mlljj$ distribution was estimated 
using a low $\Mll$ control region where data and simulated events were expected to agree.  Events from data and all simulated ST 
backgrounds in the $ee$- and $\mu\mu$-channel low $\Mll$ control regions were selected using the electron and muon triggers described in 
Chapter \ref{sec:triggers}.  Events passing the trigger selections were required to have two energetic jets and leptons 
with $\Mlljj > 600$ $\GeV$, but $\Mll < 180$ $\GeV$.  Excluding the $\Mll$ requirement, the corrections and selections 
used in the low $\Mll$ control region were identical to those used in the \WR search region (Table \ref{tab:cutCompSignalRegAndZllReg}).  
Selected events in data and simulations were used to produce $\Mlljj$ distributions, and the $\sim$15\% increase was 
applied to simulated $\DY$+jets events.  The $\Mlljj$ distributions from data and simulated events shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:mlljjLowDileptonMassSideband} were compared, and the $\Mlljj$ shape discrepancy was estimated as the largest 
percentage difference between data and the total simulated background in any bin.  The shape discrepancy magnitude was 
conservatively estimated to be 40\% in both lepton channels, constant versus $\Mlljj$.  When calculating results the 
40\% uncertainty was applied to the expected number of \DY events.

\label{fig:mlljjLowDileptonMassSideband}
\end{figure}

The $\DY$+jets simulation was produced at leading order in the strong coupling constant, and it was studied if the 40\% 
uncertainty assigned to the \DY background could be reduced by simulating higher order strong interactions.  $\DY$+jets 
events were simulated at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant, and were selected using the low $\Mll$ 
control region requirements.  Using the higher order simulation did not reduce the 40\% uncertainty, as shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:mlljjLowDileptonMassSidebandAMCNLO}.  The higher order simulation was limited by a lack of events with $\Mlljj > 600$ 
$\GeV$.  Relative to the leading order $\DY$+jets simulation, the higher order simulation had a factor of $\sim$3 fewer 
events with $\Mlljj > 600$ $\GeV$, and a factor of $\sim$10 fewer events with $\Mlljj > 1$ $\TeV$.

	the bin widths.  In the \DY events, jet production was simulated at a higher order relative to the standard \DY dataset.}
\label{fig:mlljjLowDileptonMassSidebandAMCNLO}
\end{figure}

The low $\Mlljj$ control region was used to validate the $\sim$15\% correction applied, and 40\% uncertainty assigned to 
the estimated \DY background.  In this control region, events from data and simulations of all ST backgrounds were selected 
using the \WR search requirements (Table \ref{tab:cutCompSignalRegAndZllReg}), but with $\Mlljj < 600 \GeV$.  Selected 
data and simulated events were used to make an $\Mll$ distribution, and the simulated \DY background was increased by $\sim$15\%.  
Comparing the $\Mll$ distributions found in data and simulations, shown in Figure \ref{fig:mllInLowMlljjSideband}, indicated 
that the $\sim$15\% \DY correction brought data and simulations into better agreement.  In addition, the comparison showed 
that the 40\% \DY normalization uncertainty was not too conservative, as the disagreement between data and simulated 
backgrounds approached 40\% in several bins.

The \DY background was estimated by selecting simulated \DY events with the selections described in Chapter 
\ref{sec:wrCandSelection}.  The weight of each selected event was multiplied by 1.157 in the $ee$-channel, and by 1.142 in 
the $\mu\mu$-channel.  When calculating results a 40\% uncertainty was assigned to the expected number of \DY events.


\section{Diboson and W+jets Backgrounds}
\label{sec:dibosonAndWJetsBkgnds}
The production of weak boson $W/Z$ pairs (WW, WZ, ZZ), and single W bosons in association with jets yielded events where 
two charged leptons and two jets were reconstructed and passed the signal region selections.  The number of events in 
data produced by these processes was estimated using simulated W+jets and diboson events.  The expected number of events from diboson and W+jets 
processes, shown in Figure \ref{fig:allExpectedBkgnds}, was small relative to \DY and top quark backgrounds, and concentrated 
in the region $\Mlljj < 2000\GeV$.  The diboson and W+jets processes were neglected when calculating final results for 
this search.

		signal and backgrounds.  The $ee$ ($\mu\mu$) channel was shown on the left (right).}
\end{figure}


\section{QCD Background}
\label{sec:qcdBkgnd}
The production of jets through QCD processes yielded multi-jet events where two charged leptons and two jets were reconstructed 
and passed the signal region selections.  In such events, two real jets were incorrectly reconstructed and identified as charged 
leptons.  The QCD multi-jet background expected in data was estimated by first selecting events in data with the signal region requirements 
described in Chapter \ref{sec:wrCandSelection}, but with looser identification selections applied to lepton candidates.  Events where one 
or both selected leptons passed the standard lepton identification selections were discarded, as these selected leptons were most likely 
real charged leptons.  Then, remaining events were weighted by the probability for both selected leptons, which most likely 
originated from jets, to pass the standard lepton identification requirements.  This probability was determined in an independent 
sample of data and simulated events as a function of $\eta$ and $\pt$ or $\Et$ of leptons that were incorrectly reconstructed from 
real jets.  After the probability weights were applied to selected events, the contribution of weighted events to the $\Mlljj$ 
distribution was compared to the $\Mlljj$ distribution expected from other ST backgrounds, shown in Figure \ref{fig:allExpectedBkgnds}.  
The expected QCD background was negligible, and was ignored when calculating final results for this search.
