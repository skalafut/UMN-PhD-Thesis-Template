\chapter{Background Estimation}
\label{sec:backgroundEstimation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The event selection described in Chapter \ref{sec:event_selection_chapter} was developed for high 
sensitivity to a \WR boson signal.  However, when this selection was applied to data, events from 
Standard Model (SM) processes were selected.  The number of events expected in data from SM processes 
was estimated using simulated \MC datasets listed in Chapter \ref{sec:event_selection_chapter}.  
The procedures used to calculate and validate the expected SM backgrounds are described here.

\section{Top Quark Background}
\label{sec:topQrkBkgnds}
SM processes that produced one or more top quarks constituted one of the two largest backgrounds 
to the \WR and \nul search in the $\ell\ell jj$ final state.  Based on cross sections times branching 
fractions to $\ell\ell jj$ final states listed in Chapter \ref{sec:MC}, production 
of top-anti top quark pairs ($\ttbar$, Figure \ref{fig:ttbarDiag}) and single top quarks in association 
with W bosons (t+W, Figure \ref{fig:singleTopDiags}) contributed the majority of top quark events that passed 
the full event selection.  In such processes, nearly 100\% of top quarks decayed to a bottom quark 
and SM W boson, and the W boson was free to decay to any charged lepton.  One consequence of this freedom 
was that $\ttbar$ and t+W production yielded the $e\mu jj$ final state approximately twice as often 
as the $eejj$ or $\mu\mu jj$ final states.  This consequence was instrumental in estimating the top quark 
background.

The top quark background was estimated directly from collision data that passed the $e\mu$ channel requirements.  
An estimate of the pure top quark background was possible in this channel for several reasons.  Based on the 
lepton flavor conservation assumption stated in Chapter \ref{sec:lrsPhenomenology}, a \WR signal produced 
events that passed the $e\mu$ channel selections at a rate suppressed by the weak coupling constant 
$g_{R} \sim \frac{1}{100}$.  In addition, the SM backgrounds without top quarks listed in Chapter \ref{sec:MC} 
produced events that passed the $e\mu$ channel selection at a rate suppressed by the electromagnetic coupling 
constant $\alpha \sim \frac{1}{100}$.  Thus, the $e\mu$ channel was expected to be dominated by top quark 
processes, and this was confirmed by comparing $e\mu$ data and simulations, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dataAndSimsInEMuChannel}.
