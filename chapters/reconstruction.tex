problem 1: d 
\newline
problem 2: d
\newline
disk moment of inertia = $\frac{1}{2}MR^{2} = \frac{torque}{angular accel}$\newline
so disk mass M = $\frac{2torque}{(angular accel)R^{2}} = 17.0$ kg\newline
problem 3: a
\newline
problem 4: e
\newline
problem 5: b\newline
$F_{applied}L\sin(\theta) =$ torque\newline
so $\theta = \arcsin(\frac{torque}{F_{applied}L})$ = 18 degrees
