problem 1: e 
\newline
use energy conservation, equating the initial spring potential energy to the final gravitational\newline
potential energy of the mass. If the spring constant is doubled, the initial kinetic energy of\newline
the box will be twice the kinetic energy with the original spring. In addition, since the final\newline
height of the box is linearly related to the initial kinetic energy, doubling the spring constant\newline
will double the final box height. Finally, doubling the spring constant will increase the initial\newline
velocity of the box just after it leaves the spring by $\sqrt{2}$.\newline
problem 2: c
\newline
problem 3: b
\newline
$T_{A \rightarrow B} - T_{B \rightarrow A}$ = $\frac{D}{v_{pg} - v_{ag}} - \frac{D}{v_{pg} + v_{ag}}$\newline
                                                                   
rearranging the right side of the equation to make one fraction yields\newline
$T_{A \rightarrow B} - T_{B \rightarrow A}$ = D$\frac{2v_{ag}}{v_{pg}^{2} - v_{ag}^{2}}$\newline
                                                                 
solving for the speed of the plane relative to the ground $v_{pg}$ gives\newline
$v_{pg}^{2}$ = $v_{ag}^{2} + \frac{2Dv_{ag}}{T_{A \rightarrow B} - T_{B \rightarrow A}}$\newline
$v_{pg} = 529.4 \frac{miles}{hour}$\newline

problem 4: a\newline
                                                     
given the acceleration $a_{e}$ and applied force $F_{app}$ on earth, the mass M can be calculated\newline
$M = \frac{F_{app}}{a_{e}} = \frac{90 N}{1.9 \frac{m}{s^{2}}} = 47.4$ kg\newline
                                              
weight on the moon $W_{moon}$ = $Ma_{moon}$ = $(47.4 kg)(1.62 \frac{m}{s^{2}} )$ = $76.7 N$\newline

problem 5: b\newline

use momentum conservation to determine final velocity of the heavier mass $m_{B}$\newline
$m_{A} = 2.0$ kg  initial speed $v_{A0} = 20.0 \frac{m}{s}$ to the east\newline
$m_{B} = 3.0$ kg  initial speed $v_{B0} = 20.0 \frac{m}{s}$ to the west\newline
$v_{Af} = 5.0 \frac{m}{s}$ to the west\newline

$m_{B}v_{B0}$ - $m_{A}v_{A0}$ = $m_{A}v_{Af}$ + $m_{B}v_{Bf}$\newline

solving for $v_{Bf}$ yields\newline
$v_{Bf} = \frac{m_{B}v_{B0} - m_{A}v_{A0} - m_{A}v_{Af}}{m_{B}}$\newline
$v_{Bf} = \frac{10}{3} \frac{m}{s} = 3.3 \frac{m}{s}$ to the west\newline
                                                 
the kinetic energy lost is equal to the difference between the initial kinetic\newline
energy $KE_{0}$ and final kinetic energy $KE_{f}$\newline
$KE_{0} - KE_{f}$ = (1/2)($m_{A}v_{A0}^{2} + m_{B}v_{B0}^{2} - m_{A}v_{Af}^{2} - m_{B}v_{Bf}^{2}$)\newline
$KE_{0} - KE_{f} = 958$ Joules
