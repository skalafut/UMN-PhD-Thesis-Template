The selections described in Chapter \ref{sec:event_selection_chapter} were applied to data, backgrounds 
and simulated \WR signals, and 
the selected events were used to produce $\Mlljj$ distributions in the $ee$- and $\mu\mu$-channels.  
Each $\Mlljj$ distribution ($\Mlljj > 600$ $\GeV$) was divided into smaller $\Mlljj$ windows linked 
to specific \mWR hypotheses.  The size of each window was optimized by calculating cross section $\times$ 
branching fraction limits with Bayesian statistics.

\subsection{Bayesian Limits}
\label{sec:bayesianStatsAndLimits}
Generic cross section $\times$ branching fraction limits are calculated using several quantities 
obtained after all selections were applied: the 
number of measured events $G$, the estimated number of signal events $S$ and background events $B$, 
and the signal and background event uncertainties $\delta S$ and $\delta B$.  In the \WR search, 
limits on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ were calculated in two scenarios: 
``expected'' limits where $G = B$, and ``observed'' limits, the results, where $G$ equaled the number 
of selected events in data.  Expected limits were calculated to optimize the sizes of $\Mlljj$ windows, 
in which the observed limits were calculated to test different \mWR hypotheses.  In both scenarios 
limits were calculated at 95\% confidence level (CL) using a Poisson model of the $S \plus B$ events:

\begin{equation}
	Poisson(\mu S(\pmb{\theta}) \thickspace \plus \thickspace B(\pmb{\theta}))
	\label{eq:poissonModel}
\end{equation}

where $\mu$ was the unknown, dimensionless \WR signal strength, and $\pmb{\theta}$ represented the uncertainties $\delta S$ 
and $\delta B$ described later in Section \ref{sec:uncertainties}.  Using Bayesian statistics, the probability 
distribution for $\mu$ given $G$ measured events, $p(\mu|G)$, was obtained by evaluating the integral\cite{bayesianDataAnalysis}:

\begin{equation}
	p(\mu|G) = \int p(\mu|\pmb{\theta},G)p(\pmb{\theta}|G)d\pmb{\theta}
	\label{eq:sigStrngthProbDist}
\end{equation}

where $p(\pmb{\theta}|G)$ were the probability distributions for the uncertainties given the measurement 
$G$ (``marginal posterior distributions''), and $p(\mu|\pmb{\theta},G)$ were the probability distributions 
for $\mu$ given the uncertainties, and the measurement $G$ (``conditional posterior distributions'').  
Functional forms of the marginal posterior distributions were either log-normal or Gamma distributions 
depending on the uncertainty, and are identified later in Section \ref{sec:uncertainties}.  Functional forms 
of the conditional posterior distributions were derived from uniform prior distributions and Equation 
\ref{eq:poissonModel}.  The integrals in Equation \ref{eq:sigStrngthProbDist} were evaluated 
numerically using \MC simulations to obtain $p(\mu|G)$.  Then the function $p(\mu|G)$ was integrated from $\mu =$ 0 
to $\mu = \mu_{max}$ such that 95\% of the area under $p(\mu|G)$ was covered.  The value $\mu_{max}$ was the 
95\% CL upper limit on the signal strength, and $\mu_{max}$ was multiplied by $\sigma(\WR)$ obtained from 
\WR simulations to calculate a limit on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$.

\subsection{$\Mlljj$ Windows}
\label{sec:mlljjWindows}
The shapes of the $\Mlljj$ distributions from selected ST background and \WR signal events motivated the use of 
finite size $\Mlljj$ windows to search for evidence of different \mWR hypotheses.  A \WR signal appeared as a 
peak in the $\Mlljj$ distribution, with tails above and below the peak that grew longer with increasing \mWR, 
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:signalShapesAfterSelection}.  In contrast, the total ST backgrounds appeared as a 
distribution that decreased rapidly with increasing $\Mlljj$.  This distinction in the $\Mlljj$ shape was 
transformed into greater signal over background sensitivity by dividing the $\Mlljj > 600$ $\GeV$ range into 
smaller $\Mlljj$ windows linked to specific \mWR hypotheses.  The size of each $\Mlljj$ window was optimized 
for its corresponding \mWR hypothesis using the following procedure:

%RESUME HERE
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\sim$150 $\Mlljj$ windows of different sizes were defined based on the width of the simulated \WR $\Mlljj$ distribution.
	\item In each window:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The number of signal events $S$ and background events $B$ were counted.
		\item A Poisson distribution was made with mean equal to $B$, and a random number $C$ was pulled 
			from the Poisson distribution that represented the number of measured events in the window.
		\item Using the procedure described in Section \ref{sec:bayesianStatsAndLimits}, an expected 
			upper limit on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ at 95\% CL was calculated 
			based on the probability of measuring $C$ due to fluctuations in $S$ and $B$.  To expedite the calculation, 
			only statistical uncertainties were considered in the fluctuations of $S$ and $B$.
		\item The expected limit was recalculated 300 times, and each time a new random number $C$ was 
			pulled from the Poisson distribution with mean $B$.  The expected upper limit for the window 
			was the median value of all 300 limits.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The optimized window was chosen as the window that minimized the expected upper limit.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

The optimized windows, listed in Table \ref{tab:masscuts}, overlapped in $\Mlljj$ because 
each selected event could be consistent with several \mWR hypotheses.  In each window the number of selected 
events in data, estimated $\DY$ and top quark backgrounds, and the appropriate \WR simulation\footnote{The window 
optimized for $\mWR = 1000$ $\GeV$ only considered signal events produced in the $\mWR = 1000$ $\GeV$ simulation.} 
were counted, and were used to calculate observed and expected upper limits on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$.  
The uncertainties affecting these limits were calculated using procedures described next.

\section{Uncertainties}
\label{sec:uncertainties}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The precision of expected and observed limits was reduced by uncertainties on the number of selected signal 
and background events.  In every $\Mlljj$ window the uncertainty magnitudes were estimated and quantified as a 
percentage uncertainty on the number of counted events.

\subsection{Primary Uncertainties}
\label{sec:dominantUncs}

\subsubsection{Energy and Lepton Identification Uncertainties}
\label{sec:enrgyLeptIdUncs}
The only uncertainties that affected the shape of the $\Mlljj$ distribution found in signal and background 
events were uncertainties on the lepton and jet energy resolutions and calibration scales.  The magnitude of 
these uncertainties varied with selected particle kinematic variables like energy and $(\eta,\phi)$ trajectory, 
but never exceeded 25\% for jets, and $\sim$7\% for electrons and muons.  These energy uncertainties changed 
the energies of all reconstructed leptons and jets, and therefore could change the $\Mlljj$ value of a 
selected event, or cause an event to pass (fail) the selection when initially, ignoring energy uncertainties, 
the event failed (passed) the selection.  For convenience, the effect of lepton and jet energy uncertainties 
were estimated simultaneously with the effect of lepton ID uncertainties, which only affected the weight of 
selected simulated events.  Independently considering simulated $\WR$ signal events, simulated $\DY$ events, 
and $e\mu$ data events representing the top quark background, the effect of lepton and jet energy uncertainties 
and lepton ID uncertainties was estimated using the following procedure:

\begin{itemize}
	\item In each event selected by a trigger, but before any lepton or jet selections:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Eight random numbers were pulled from eight different Gaussians, each with mean 0 and variance 1.
		\item Two random numbers multiplied the electron energy scale and resolution uncertainty of each electron, and these 
			energy changes were propagated to every electron.  In simulated events, a third random number multiplied 
			the ID weight uncertainty of each electron, and the change in weight was propagated to the total event weight 
			after all selections.
		\item Three other random numbers were used to determine the effect of muon energy and ID uncertainties (ID uncertainty 
			only considered in simulated events) following the same procedure used for electrons.
		\item The remaining two random numbers multiplied the jet energy scale and resolution uncertainty of each jet, and 
			these energy changes were propagated to every jet.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The offline selections described in Chapter \ref{sec:event_selection_chapter} were applied to each event.  If all 
		requirements were met and a \WR candidate was built, the event was assigned to one or more $\Mlljj$ windows based on 
		the \WR candidate mass.
\end{itemize}

This procedure was repeated 3200 times for every event.  For each signal and background process, distributions 
of the number of events in each $\Mlljj$ window for all 3200 iterations were made, of which an example  
is shown in Figure \ref{fig:effectOfEnergyIdUncerts}.  The 
distribution's standard deviation represented the uncertainty on the number of events due 
to energy and ID uncertainties.  The uncertainties on the number of signal and background events in one $\Mlljj$ 
window due to energy and ID uncertainties is shown in Table \ref{tab:impactOfEnergyIdUncerts}.  The effect of 
these uncertainties were included in limit calculations by using Gamma distributions for the marginal posterior 
distributions.

	 Top quark background & lepton energy & $8$ & $8$ \\
	 Top quark background & jet energy & $2$ & $2$  \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Statistical Uncertainty}
\label{sec:statUnc}
The statistical uncertainty was calculated for each signal and background source as 
$\sqrt{\sum w_{i}^{2}}$, where $w_{i}$ was the weight of event i, and the sum ran over all selected events 
in a $\Mlljj$ window.  The top quark background was estimated using $e\mu$ data events all with a weight of 
1, while simulated \WR and \DY events had positive weights $<$ 1.  Comparing signal and background statistical 
uncertainties, the statistical uncertainty was largest for the top quark background, as shown in Table 
\ref{tab:impactOfStatUncert}.  No $e\mu$ data events had $\Memujj \geq 2700$ $\GeV$, so the top quark 
background estimate was 0 events for signal hypotheses with $\mWR \geq 3600$ $\GeV$, and the standard 
statistical uncertainty formula could not be used.  In $\Mlljj$ windows where the top quark background estimate 
was 0 events, the statistical uncertainty assigned to 0 events was 1 $e\mu$ event multiplied by the appropriate 
$\ell\ell:e\mu$ normalization factor, 0.659 or 0.432.  The effect of statistical uncertainties were included 
in limit calculations by using Gamma distributions for the marginal posterior distributions.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\caption{Impact of statistical uncertainty on the number of expected signal and background events in the $\Mlljj$ 
		window optimized for the $\mWR = 2.2\TeV$ hypothesis.  All uncertainties are in percentages of expected events.}

  \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
		Process & $\Delta(\Neejj)$ (\%) & $\Delta(\Nmumujj)$ (\%)  \\
      \hline
	  \WR & $1$ & $1$ \\
	  \DY & $6$ & $5$ \\
	 Top quark background & $44$ & $44$  \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Background Uncertainty from Control Regions}
\label{sec:bkgndNormUnc}
Based on previously discussed comparisons between data and simulated backgrounds in control regions, 
additional uncertainties independent of $\Mlljj$ were applied to background estimates.  A 10\% 
uncertainty was assigned to the top quark background estimate to account for fluctuations in the 
$\ell\ell:e\mu$ normalization factor versus $\Mlljj$.  A 40\% uncertainty was applied to the $\DY$ 
background estimate to account for disagreement between data and simulated $\DY$+jets events in 
the $\Mlljj$ distribution in the low $\Mll$ control region.  The effect of these uncertainties were 
included in limit calculations using log-normal distributions for the marginal posterior distributions.

\subsection{Secondary Uncertainties}
\label{sec:subdominantUncs}

\subsubsection{Lepton Reconstruction and Trigger Efficiency Uncertainties}
\label{sec:leptonRecoTriggerEffUnc}
The efficiencies of lepton reconstruction and muon trigger selections differed between events selected 
in simulations and in data, and these differences were corrected by applying $\sim$unity weights to simulated 
\DY and \WR events.  In the $\mu\mu$-channel, the trigger and lepton reconstruction 
efficiency weights varied with the $\pt$ and $\eta$ of selected muons, and the weight uncertainties 
were statistical uncertainties, determined by the number of data and simulated events used to calculate 
the weights.  The uncertainty on the muon reconstruction efficiency weights was negligible.  The muon 
trigger efficiency weight uncertainty was $<$ 0.5\% for events triggered by muons with $\pt < 140$ $\GeV$.  For 
events triggered by muons with $\pt \geq 140$ $\GeV$, the trigger efficiency weight uncertainty was higher 
because fewer data events were available to calculate the weight: $<$ 3\% uncertainty for triggering 
muons with $|\eta| < 2.1$, and 5.1\% uncertainty for triggering muons with $2.1 < |\eta| < 2.4$.  In 
the $ee$-channel, an electron reconstruction efficiency weight of 0.982 was applied to all selected 
electrons.  The reconstruction weight uncertainty was calculated as the maximum difference between 0.982 and 
an $\Et,\eta$ dependent weight, and was 2\%.  The effect of lepton reconstruction and trigger selection 
efficiency uncertainties were included in limit calculations using log-normal distributions for the marginal 
posterior distributions.

\subsubsection{Cross Section, Luminosity, Pileup and PDF Uncertainties}
\label{sec:crossSxnPileupPdfUnc}
The \DY background and \WR signal were estimated using simulated events whose event weights were 
susceptible to uncertainties on cross sections, pileup, integrated luminosity, parton distribution functions 
(PDFs), and QCD scales.  The \DY cross section uncertainty was 2\% (1\%) in the $ee$- ($\mu\mu$-) channel, 
and was estimated by comparing data to simulated \DY datasets produced with different \MC generators in 
the $Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$ control region discussed earlier.  Treating PDF uncertainties separately, the 
\WR cross section uncertainty was proportional to the uncertainties on the ST top quark mass, and the 
ST $W$ boson coupling strengths to ST fermions.  These ST uncertainties are $<$ 0.5\%, and so 
the \WR cross section uncertainty was negligible.

The efficiency in data to reconstruct an interaction as a vertex could not be measured exactly, so an 
analytic, multivariate function was used to approximate this efficiency in data.  This function was used to 
derive the pileup weights\footnote{The pileup weights were equal to the pileup distribution in data 
divided by the pileup distribution in simulated events} $w_{PU}$ applied to simulated events, and uncertainty 
in the function's parameters created uncertainty in $w_{PU}$.  The $w_{PU}$ uncertainty was estimated by 
shifting the pileup distribution in data without changing its shape so that the mean pileup value increased 
or decreased by 5\%.  New pileup weights $w_{PU,\Uparrow}$ and $w_{PU,\Downarrow}$ were calculated after the 
upward and downward shifts, and the $w_{PU}$ uncertainty was calculated as the maximum change in 
events in a $\Mlljj$ window between the original and new weights.  For \DY and \WR event estimates, the pileup 
uncertainty was 3\% or less in all $\Mlljj$ windows.

Knowing the cross sections of the \WR and \DY processes, the numbers of \WR and \DY events were normalized 
to the measured integrated luminosity of data.  The integrated luminosity of data was measured with a 2.7\% 
uncertainty, which translated into a 2.7\% luminosity uncertainty on the number of \WR and \DY events in 
every $\Mlljj$ window.

\DY and \WR events were simulated using:

\begin{itemize}
	\item One parton distribution function (PDF) that described how momenta were distributed amongst quark and 
		gluon constituents of colliding protons.  \WR simulations used NNPDF23 \cite{nnpdf23}, \DY simulations 
		used NNPDF30 \cite{nnpdf30}, and both PDFs were characterized by fixed value coefficients with uncertainties.
	\item One renormalization scale value $\mu_{R}$ (in $\GeV$) that determined the QCD coupling strength $\alpha_{QCD}$.
	\item One factorization scale value $\mu_{F}$ (in $\GeV$), which allowed QCD interactions with low momentum transfer 
		$k_{low} \ll \mu_{F}$ to be simulated independently of QCD interactions with high momentum transfer 
		$k_{high} \sim \mu_{F}$ (explained further in \cite{qcdFactorizationTheory}).
\end{itemize}

The effect of uncertainties in the PDF, $\mu_{R}$ and $\mu_{F}$ (QCD scale) values were estimated by resimulating \DY and 
\WR events with different PDF coefficients and QCD scale values, and subsequently reapplying all event selections 
and corrections.  The QCD scales were independently increased or decreased by a factor of 2 
(both were doubled, one was not changed while the other was halved, etc), and the QCD scale uncertainty was 
calculated as the maximum change in events in a $\Mlljj$ window between the original and modified 
scales.  Similarly, the PDF coefficients were increased and decreased independently to test $\sim$300 different 
sets of PDF coefficients, and the PDF uncertainty was calculated as the average change in the number of events 
when the original PDF coefficients were exchanged for any other set of coefficients.  The QCD scale uncertainty 
was added in quadrature with the PDF uncertainty; in \DY events their combination never exceeded 4\% in any 
$\Mlljj$ window.  The combined PDF and QCD scale uncertainty in \WR events was only estimated in the $\Mlljj$ 
window optimized for a particular \mWR hypothesis.  The QCD scale uncertainty never exceeded 5\% for any \mWR 
hypothesis, but the PDF uncertainty increased with \mWR from 1\% to 15\%, as shown in Table \ref{tab:wrPdfAndQCDscaleUnc}.  
Following CMS guidelines, the \WR PDF uncertainty was factored into two pieces: one piece that affected the 
production rate of the \WR, and another piece that affected the $(\eta,\phi)$ of final state leptons and jets.  
The PDF uncertainty affecting $(\eta,\phi)$ was included in limit calculations, and was $\lesssim$ 1\% for all 
\mWR hypotheses.  The other PDF uncertainty increased in magnitude with \mWR, but since its magnitude depended 
on the model being tested, it was not included in limit calculations.

The effect of uncertainties on cross sections, pileup, integrated luminosity, PDFs, and QCD scales on the number 
of \DY and \WR events were included in limit calculations using log-normal distributions for the marginal posterior 
distributions.

\subsection{Cumulative Uncertainty}
\label{sec:cumulativeUnc}
The cumulative effect of all uncertainty sources on the number of ST background and \WR signal events in several 
$\Mlljj$ windows is shown in Table \ref{tab:expectedEventsAndAllUncs}.  All uncertainties excluding the statistical 
uncertainty are labeled as systematic uncertainties, and the magnitudes of all systematic uncertainties were summed 
in quadrature.  The dominant uncertainty affecting the \DY background was the 40\% uncertainty assigned based on 
disagreement between data and simulated ST background events in a control region where good agreement was expected.  
The dominant uncertainty affecting the top quark background was the statistical uncertainty, as $<$ 500 $e\mu$ 
data events were available to estimate the top quark background with $\Mlljj > 600\GeV$.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:searchResults}
Evidence of LRS models was searched for by comparing selected events in data, \WR signal, and ST backgrounds.  Initial 
results were obtained by comparing the $\Meejj$ and $\Mmumujj$ distributions between data and ST backgrounds with 
(Table \ref{tab:expAndObsEvtsWithAllUncs}) and without (Figure \ref{fig:obsAndExpMlljj}) the $\Mlljj$ window cuts.  
No statistically significant excess was found in data relative to the backgrounds, so limits on 
$\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ were calculated.

\begin{table}[htp]

		events in each $\Mlljj$ window, and their uncertainties.  Each uncertainty is shown as a number of events.

Upper limits on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ were calculated at 95\% CL in each $\Mlljj$ 
window assuming $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$.  Expected limits were 
calculated by setting the measured number of events $\Nlljj$ equal to the number of ST background events, while 
observed limits were calculated by setting $\Nlljj$ equal to the number of events found in data.  The expected 
and observed limits as functions of \mWR are shown in Figure \ref{fig:oneDimLimits}.  Subsequently, the expected 
and observed limits on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ for $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$ were 
extrapolated into \mnul and \mWR exclusion limits.

The limits on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ for $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$ were directly 
related to the signal efficiency $\chi$ of the event selection multiplied by the \WR cross section $\sigma(\WR)$, 
$\chi \times \sigma(\WR)$.  Since the estimated background was not sensitive to the \mnul hypothesis, the limits at 
two points with the same \mWR but different \mnul only differed by the ratio of $\chi \times \sigma(\WR)$ between 
the two points.  Thus, knowing the $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ limit for 
$\mWR^{a}, \mnul^{a} = \frac{1}{2}\mWR^{a}$, the limit at $\mWR^{a}, \mnul^{b} \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR^{a}$ was 
calculated as:

%no type of multiplication sign looks good between the fraction and the Limit written on the right side of this equation
\begin{equation}
	Limit[(\mWR^{a}, \mnul^{b} \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR^{a})] = \frac{\chi[(\mWR^{a}, \mnul^{b} \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR^{a})]}{\chi[(\mWR^{a}, \mnul^{a} = \frac{1}{2}\mWR^{a})]} \quad Limit[(\mWR^{a}, \mnul^{a} = \frac{1}{2}\mWR^{a})]
\label{eq:limitExtrapolation}
\end{equation}

The dependence of $\chi$ on \mnul and \mWR was estimated by simulating additional 15000 event $\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj$ 
samples with \mWR between 800 and 4000 $\GeV$, and many values of \mnul between 0 $\GeV$ and \mWR at each value 
of \mWR.  
%in steps of:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item 25 $\GeV$ from 0 to 300 $\GeV$,
%	\item 100 $\GeV$ from 300 to $\mWR - 200$ $\GeV$,
%	\item 25 $\GeV$ from $\mWR - 200$ to \mWR $\GeV$
%\end{itemize}
%Smaller steps were used in regions where $\chi$ had a strong dependence on \mnul.
The traditional full simulation used to produce \WR samples with $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$ required enormous computational 
resources that were not available for the limit extrapolation procedure described here.  Instead, additional \WR 
simulations were produced using only the first simulation step.  \PYTHIA simulated the \WR production and decay into 
leptons and quarks, and the hadronization of quarks into jets.  Similar to reconstructed jets, jets from \PYTHIA 
were clustered from individual hadrons, leptons and photons in a cone of radius $\Delta R =$ 0.4.  After event generation 
and jet clustering, the offline selection used in fully reconstructed events was applied, excluding lepton and jet ID 
selections.  The efficiency of this selection $\chi^'$ was measured as a function of $(\mWR, \mnul)$, and used in place 
of $\chi$.  Then, the limits on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ calculated for $(\mWR, \mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR)$ 
were extrapolated to limits $L'$ for $\mnul \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR$ using $\chi^'$ and Equation \ref{eq:limitExtrapolation}.  
The resulting $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ limits were rescaled by $\sigma(\WR)$ for 
$\mnul \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR$ to calculate \mnul and \mWR exclusion limits at 95\% CL, and are shown in Figure \ref{fig:twoDimLimits}.

The difference between $\chi^'$ (without reconstruction) and $\chi$ (with reconstruction) was checked by simulating 
$\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj$ at $\mWR =$ 2400 and 4000 $\GeV$ and several $\mnul \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR$ including detector 
response simulations and particle reconstruction.  Simulated events were selected with the online and offline selection 
requirements, and limits $L_{true}$ on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ were calculated at each 
$(\mWR, \mnul \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR)$ point.  For $\mnul \gtrsim \frac{1}{8}\mWR$, $L_{true}$ and $L'$ were consistent 
within their uncertainties.  For $\mnul \lesssim \frac{1}{8}\mWR$, the limit $L_{true}$ was stronger (the minimum excluded 
\mnul was lower) than $L'$ because of pileup jets.  $L_{true}$ was calculated using simulated events that included 
pileup interactions (on average 10 per event) that produced pileup jets, which enabled more \WR events to pass the full 
selection.  The resulting increase in signal selection efficiency $\chi$ extended the excluded \WR production region to 
lower \mnul values.  In the $\mnul \lesssim \frac{1}{8}\mWR$ region, the efficiencies $\chi$ (with reconstruction) 
and $\chi^'$ (without reconstruction) were below 10\% for all \mWR, and the difference in lower bounds on \mnul 
was less than 100 $\GeV$.  The extrapolated limit $L'$ represented the result, and, since the extrapolated limit $L'$ 
was weaker than the limit $L_{true}$, no correction was applied to the extrapolated limit $L'$.

Using data collected in 2015 \mWR production was excluded at 95\% CL for $\mWR \lesssim 3500 (3300) \GeV$ in the $\mu\mu$- 
($ee$-) channel.  The exclusion limits were consistent with ST expectations, and extended the mass limits in the $\mu\mu$- 
($ee$-) channel 400 $\GeV$ (400 $\GeV$) higher in \mWR, and 150 $\GeV$ (300 $\GeV$) higher in \mnul relative to the Run I limits.
