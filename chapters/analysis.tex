The results and their uncertainties obtained in this search are presented here.  Evidence in 
support of a \WR and \nul signal was sought in finite sized windows of $\Mlljj$, whose sizes 
were chosen to minimize the upper bound \WR cross section limit in the absence of a signal.  
Uncertainties that affected the background and signal estimates were measured in each $\Mlljj$ 
window.  The main uncertainties that affected the background estimate arose from limited event 
statistics in $e\mu$ data, and discrepancies between data and simulations in \DY-rich control 
regions.  The main uncertainties that affected the signal estimate came from luminosity and 
pileup measurements in data.  Additional sources of uncertainty existed and were measured, 
but had a smaller cumulative impact on the results.  Following uncertainty estimation, the 
results were obtained by comparing data, expected SM backgrounds and hypothetical 
\WR and \nul signals using the $\Mlljj$ distribution, and limits on the \WR cross section, 
$\mWR$ and $\mnul$ masses.
