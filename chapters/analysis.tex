a. the raft moves at $\frac{1}{6} \frac{m}{s}$ or $0.2 \frac{m}{s}$ relative to the water, once significant figures are accounted for

the raft moves relative to the water at a speed $S_{r}$ to conserve momentum
$m_{r}$ = raft mass = $300.0$ kg
$m_{J}$ = mass of Jane = $60.0$ kg
$S_{J}$ = walking speed of Jane relative to the water
$S_{J} + S_{r}$ = walking speed of Jane relative to raft = $1.00 \frac{m}{s}$

$m_{r} S_{r}$ = $m_{J} S_{J} \rightarrow S_{r} = \frac{m_{J} S_{J}}{m_{r}} = 0.200 \frac{m}{s}$ 

$m_{J}$($S_{J} + S_{r}$) = ($m_{r}$ + $m_{J}$)$S_{r} \rightarrow S_{r} = \frac{m_{J}(1.00 \frac{m}{s})}{m_{J} + m_{r} } $
$S_{r} = \frac{1}{6} \frac{m}{s}$

b. Jane moves at $\frac{5}{6} \frac{m}{s}$ or $0.8 \frac{m}{s}$ relative to the water, once significant figures are accounted for

c. the raft moves $0.8$ meters while Jane is walking

$S_{r}$(5.0 seconds) = $\frac{1}{6} \frac{m}{s}$(5.0 seconds) = $\frac{5}{6}$ meters or $0.8$ meters

d. $0 \frac{m}{s}$ the raft stops moving when Jane stops walking

e. the raft moves at a speed of $0.4 \frac{m}{s}$ relative to the water after Jane jumps

the raft will move at a speed $S_{r}^{final}$to balance the momentum created by Jane 
jumping off of the raft at a speed $S_{J}^{jump} = 2.00 \frac{m}{s}$.

$S_{r}^{final} = \frac{ m_{J} S_{J}^{jump}}{m_{r}} = 0.4 \frac{m}{s}$

f. if drag between the raft and water is ignored, then the raft will continue to move
after Jane lands and stops.  Jane uses her muscles to stop, but the raft has nothing
to impede its motion.
