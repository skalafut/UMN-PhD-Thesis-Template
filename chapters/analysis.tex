After estimating the background, the $\Mlljj$ distributions found in the selected data and predicted background events 
were compared.  The difference between the number of data and background events was compared to the background uncertainty, 
the predicted number of simulated \WR events, and the \WR prediction uncertainty (simulation details in Appendix \ref{app_wrMC}).  
The $\Mlljj$ distribution found in simulated \WR events was several hundred $\GeV$ wide or larger (Figure 
\ref{fig:signalShapes}), so excesses of data events above the background can be consistent with several \mWR hypotheses.  
A set of $\Mlljj$ windows, each tailored to the $\Mlljj$ distribution of a specific \mWR hypothesis, was used to interpret 
the excesses of data in the context of different \mWR hypotheses.  The sizes of these windows, the uncertainties on 
the number of signal and background events, and the results of the comparisons were determined using the procedures described 
here.

\section{Statistical Analysis}
\label{sec:statAnalysis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The number of $\Mlljj$ windows was chosen based on how the $\Mlljj$ distribution found in selected 
simulated \WR events changed with \mWR and \mnul.  For a fixed \mWR, the shape of the $\Mlljj$ distribution found in signal 
events is weakly dependent on \mnul (Figure \ref{fig:mWrShapeVsMNu}), only because the $\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj$ cross 
section $\times$ branching ratio varies weakly with \mnul.  Since the shape varies weakly with \mnul, one $\Mlljj$ window is 
assigned per \mWR, independent of \mnul.  The $\Mlljj$ window size for a specific \mWR is determined using events that have 
$\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$, because at this $\mnul$ the event selection efficiency is maximized or nearly maximized.  As \mWR 
increases the $\Mlljj$ distribution shape shifts to higher values, and the distribution normalization 
decreases with the \WR cross section $\times$ branching ratio.  However, for $X \geq 2.0$ $\TeV$, the $\Mlljj$ distributions 
found in signal events that have $\mWR = X$ and $\mWR = X + 0.2$ $\TeV$ overlap by 10\% or more (Figure \ref{fig:mWrShapeVsMWr}).  
The two $\Mlljj$ windows that are used for $\mWR = X$ and $\mWR = X + 0.2$ $\TeV$ are sensitive to signals that have 
$X < \mWR < X + 0.2$ $\TeV$, so finer granularity in \mWR is not needed.  To cover the entire $\Mlljj$ spectrum found in the 
data, one $\Mlljj$ window is assigned to each value of \mWR stepping from 0.8 to 6 $\TeV$ in increments of 0.2 $\TeV$.  The size 
of each $\Mlljj$ window was determined based on the shape and normalization of the $\Mlljj$ distribution found in background 
events.  Specifically, each window's size was chosen to maximize the difference between the number of signal and background 
events, and thus minimize the upper limit on the \WR cross section $\times$ branching ratio.

\subsection{Bayesian Limits}
\label{sec:bayesianStatsAndLimits}
The \WR cross section $\times$ branching ratio ($\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$) limits are calculated 
using several quantities.  Each limit for a specific \mWR signal is calculated using the number of measured events $G$ and 
predicted signal ($S$) and background ($B$) events in the $\Mlljj$ window, and their uncertainties $\delta S$ and $\delta B$.  
Expected limits, calculated by setting $G = B$, were used to determine the sizes of the $\Mlljj$ bins.  Expected limits were 
calculated at 95\% confidence level (CL) using a Poisson model of the $S \plus B$ events:

\begin{equation}
	Poisson(\mu S(\pmb{\theta}) \thickspace \plus \thickspace B(\pmb{\theta}))
	\label{eq:poissonModel}
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the dimensionless \WR signal strength, and $\pmb{\theta}$ represent the uncertainties $\delta S$ and $\delta B$ 
described later in Section \ref{sec:uncertainties}.  Using Bayesian statistics, the probability distribution for $\mu$ given 
$G$ measured events, $p(\mu|G)$, is obtained by evaluating the integral \cite{bayesianDataAnalysis}:

\begin{equation}
	p(\mu|G) = \int p(\mu|\pmb{\theta},G)p(\pmb{\theta}|G)d\pmb{\theta}
	\label{eq:sigStrngthProbDist}
\end{equation}
where $p(\pmb{\theta}|G)$ are the probability distributions for the uncertainties given the measurement $G$ (``marginal 
posterior distributions''), and $p(\mu|\pmb{\theta},G)$ are the probability distributions for $\mu$ given the uncertainties, 
and the measurement $G$ (``conditional posterior distributions'').  Functional forms of the marginal posterior distributions 
are either log-normal or Gamma distributions depending on the uncertainty, and are identified later for specific uncertainties.  
Functional forms of the conditional posterior distributions are derived from uniform prior distributions and Equation 
\ref{eq:poissonModel}.  The integrals in Equation \ref{eq:sigStrngthProbDist} were evaluated numerically using \MC methods 
to derive $p(\mu|G)$.  Then, $p(\mu|G)$ was integrated from $\mu =$ 0 to $\mu = \mu_{max}$ such that the normalized integral 
equaled 0.95.  The value $\mu_{max}$ is the 95\% CL upper limit on the signal strength.  The value of $\sigma(\WR) \times 
BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ obtained from simulations is multiplied by $\mu_{max}$ to calculate the upper limit on 
$\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$.

\subsection{$\Mlljj$ Window Sizes}
\label{sec:mlljjWindows}
The sizes of the $\Mlljj$ windows were chosen to minimize the 95\% CL upper limit on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$.  
For each value of \mWR between 0.8 and 6 $\TeV$, the size of the corresponding window was determined using the following 
procedure:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 150 $\Mlljj$ windows of different sizes and central values were defined based on the peak position in the \WR $\Mlljj$ 
		distribution.  The window lower bound went down to 40\% of \mWR, and the upper bound went up to 140\% of \mWR.
	\item For each window:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The number of signal events $S$ and background events $B$ were counted.
		\item A Poisson distribution was created with mean $B$, and a random number $C$ was pulled 
			from the Poisson distribution.  $C$ represents the number of measured events in the window.
		\item Using $C$, $S$, $B$, and the procedure described in Section \ref{sec:bayesianStatsAndLimits}, an 
			expected upper limit on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ was calculated at 
			95\% CL.  The systematic uncertainties on $S$ and $B$ had a negligible effect on the final 
			window size, so only the statistical uncertainties on $S$ and $B$ were included.
		\item The limit was recalculated 300 times, and each time a new random number $C$ was pulled 
			from the Poisson distribution.  The median value of all 300 limits is the expected upper limit 
			for the window.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The window that minimized the expected upper limit was chosen.
\end{itemize}

The $\Mlljj$ windows, listed in Table \ref{tab:masscuts}, capture at least 70\% of the corresponding \WR $\Mlljj$ distribution.  
The central value of each window ($\frac{max \plus min}{2}$) exceeds the corresponding \mWR value to minimize the predicted 
background, which falls rapidly with increasing $\Mlljj$.

\section{Uncertainties}
\label{sec:uncertainties}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In each window, the observed limit, using data, and the expected limit were calculated with all systematic and statistical 
uncertainties included.  The dominant uncertainties were the 40\% $\DY$+jets uncertainty, the lepton and jet energy 
uncertainties, and the top quark background statistical uncertainty.  The magnitudes of these uncertainties and all 
others that affected the number of predicted signal and background events were calculated using the procedures described 
here.  The uncertainty magnitude is the same for all $\Mlljj$ windows unless noted otherwise.

\subsection{Energy and Lepton Identification Uncertainties}
\label{sec:enrgyLeptIdUncs}
The lepton and jet energy uncertainties are unique in that they are the only uncertainties that can change the shapes of 
the $\Mlljj$ distributions found in signal and background events.  These uncertainties, specifically on the lepton and 
jet energy scales and resolutions, affect the energies of all reconstructed leptons and jets in every event.  Variations 
of lepton and jet energies within their uncertainties can cause each event to pass or fail the selection criteria, or 
change a selected event's $\Mlljj$ value.  The jet energy uncertainties went up to 25\% for jets that had low $\pt$ and 
large $|\eta|$, and the lepton energy uncertainties went up to $\sim$7\% for electrons and muons.  The efficiency of the 
lepton ID selection criteria is sensitive to lepton and jet energies, so the energy uncertainties are correlated with the 
lepton ID selection efficiency uncertainty.  The effect of energy and lepton ID uncertainties were estimated simultaneously 
using the following procedure:

\begin{itemize}
	\item In each event selected by a trigger, but before applying any lepton or jet selection criteria:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Eight random numbers were pulled from eight different Gaussians, each with mean 0 and variance 1.
		\item Two random numbers multiplied each electron's energy scale and resolution uncertainty to determine the 
			energy change applied to each electron.  In simulated events, a third random number multiplied 
			each electron's ID weight uncertainty, and the change in weight of the two selected electrons was propagated 
			to the total event weight.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Using the same procedure with three other random numbers, the effect of muon energy and ID uncertainties 
				were propagated to each muon's energy and ID weight.
		\end{itemize}
		\item The last two random numbers multiplied every jet's energy scale and resolution uncertainty, and these 
			energy changes were added to the jet's energy.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The offline selection criteria were applied to each event.  Selected events were assigned to $\Mlljj$ 
		bins based on their $\Mlljj$ values.
\end{itemize}

This procedure was repeated 3200 times for every event used to predict the signal and background $\Mlljj$ distributions.  
Then, a distribution was made showing the number of selected events in each window for all 3200 iterations (Figure 
\ref{fig:effectOfEnergyIdUncerts}).  The distribution's standard deviation is the uncertainty on the number of events 
due to all energy and lepton ID uncertainties.  In $\Mlljj$ windows for signals that have $\mWR \geq 2$ $\TeV$, the effect 
of the energy and ID uncertainties was an uncertainty of $\lesssim$4\% on the number of \WR events, and larger uncertainties 
on the number of background events (Table \ref{tab:impactOfEnergyIdUncerts}).  These uncertainties were included in limit 
calculations using Gamma distributions for the marginal posterior distributions.

	 Top quark background & jet energy & $2$ & $2$  \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Statistical Uncertainty}
\label{sec:statUnc}
The statistical uncertainty was calculated for each signal and background source as $\sqrt{\sum w_{i}^{2}}$, where 
$w_{i}$ was the weight of event i, and the sum ran over all selected events in a $\Mlljj$ window.  The $e\mu$ data 
events used to estimate the top quark background all had a weight of 1, while simulated \WR and \DY events had positive 
weights $<$1 because the number of simulated events exceeded the number of events expected in 2.6 fb$^{-1}$ of data.  
In the mass windows for $\mWR \geq 2$ $\TeV$ hypotheses, the statistical uncertainty was $<$2\% on the number 
of \WR events, $\geq$5\% on the number of \DY events, and $>$30\% on the number of top quark events, as shown in 
Table \ref{tab:impactOfStatUncert}.  These uncertainties were included in limit calculations by using Gamma distributions 
for the marginal posterior distributions.

%RESUME HERE

Every $\Mlljj$ window had more than one simulated \DY and \WR event, so the formula $\sqrt{\sum w_{i}^{2}}$ could always 
be used to calculate the statistical uncertainty on the number of \DY and \WR events.  However, the absence of $e\mu$ 
data events with $\Memujj \geq 2700$ $\GeV$ resulted in 0 predicted top quark events in mass windows optimized for 
$\mWR \geq 3600$ $\GeV$ hypotheses.  In this high \mWR region the top quark background statistical uncertainty was 
calculated as 1 $e\mu$ event multiplied by the appropriate $\ell\ell:e\mu$ normalization factor - 0.659 or 0.432.

	  \DY & $6$ & $5$ \\
	 Top quark background & $44$ & $44$  \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Background Uncertainty from Control Regions}
\label{sec:bkgndNormUnc}
Additional uncertainties were assigned to background estimates based on previously discussed studies of data and simulated 
backgrounds in control regions.  A 10\% uncertainty was assigned to the top quark background estimate to account for 
fluctuations in the $\ell\ell:e\mu$ normalization factors versus $\Mlljj$.  A 40\% uncertainty was assigned to the \DY 
background estimate to account for disagreement between data and simulated $\DY$+jets events in the $\Mlljj$ distribution 
in the low $\Mll$ control region.  These uncertainties were included in limit calculations using log-normal distributions 
for the marginal posterior distributions.

\subsection{Lepton Reconstruction and Trigger Efficiency Uncertainties}
\label{sec:leptonRecoTriggerEffUnc}
The efficiencies of lepton reconstruction and muon trigger selections differed between selected data and simulated events, 
and these differences were corrected in simulated events by applying $\sim$unity event weights.  In the $\mu\mu$-channel, 
the trigger and lepton reconstruction efficiency weights, and their uncertainties, varied with the $\pt$ and $\eta$ of selected 
muons, and the uncertainty magnitudes were calculated based on the number of data and simulated events used to calculate the 
weights.  The muon reconstruction weight uncertainty was negligible.  The muon trigger weight uncertainty was $<$ 0.5\% for 
events triggered by muons with $\pt < 140$ $\GeV$.  For events triggered by higher $\pt$ muons, the trigger weight uncertainty 
was $<$ 3\% when the triggering muon had $|\eta| < 2.1$, and was 5.1\% when the triggering muon had $2.1 < |\eta| < 2.4$.  In 
the $ee$-channel, an electron reconstruction efficiency weight of 0.982 was applied to all selected electrons, and propagated 
into the weight of each event.  The electron reconstruction weight uncertainty was calculated as the maximum difference between 
0.982 and an $\Et,\eta$ dependent weight, and was found to be 2\%.  The lepton reconstruction and trigger uncertainties were 
included in limit calculations using log-normal distributions for the marginal posterior distributions.

\subsection{Cross Section, Luminosity, Pileup and PDF Uncertainties}
\label{sec:crossSxnPileupPdfUnc}
Simulated events were also weighted to normalize the events to the integrated luminosity of data, and to account for the pileup 
distribution measured in data, and the effects of parton distribution functions (PDFs), and renormalization and factorization 
energy scales.  Uncertainties on these weights lead to additional uncertainties on the number of selected \DY and \WR events.  
The uncertainties on the number of selected events in each $\Mlljj$ window were estimated as follows.

The \DY cross section uncertainty was estimated by comparing data to three sets of simulated \DY events in the 
$Z \rightarrow \ell\ell$ control region discussed earlier, and was found to be 2\% (1\%) in the $ee$- ($\mu\mu$-) channel.  
At each \mWR value the \WR cross section was calculated during simulations based on the fraction of \MC trials executed that 
produced \WR events in the kinematically allowed phase space.  The cross section uncertainty was calculated as the uncertainty 
on this fraction, and was $<$0.5\% for all values of \mWR.

The \WR and \DY events were normalized to the measured integrated luminosity of data using the \WR and \DY cross sections 
calculated in simulations.  The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity measurement in data lead to a 2.7\% uncertainty on the 
number of \WR and \DY events in every $\Mlljj$ window.

The efficiency in data to reconstruct an interaction as a vertex could not be measured exactly, so an analytic 
function was used to approximate this efficiency.  This function was used to derive the pileup weights\footnote{The pileup 
weights were equal to the pileup distribution in data divided by the pileup distribution in simulated events} $w_{PU}$ applied 
to simulated events, and the uncertainties in this function's parameters lead to an uncertainty in $w_{PU}$.  The $w_{PU}$ uncertainty 
was estimated by first shifting the pileup distribution in data without changing its shape so that the mean pileup value increased 
or decreased by 5\%.  After the upward and downward shifts new pileup weights $w_{PU,\Uparrow}$ and $w_{PU,\Downarrow}$ were 
calculated.  Using selected events the $w_{PU}$ uncertainty was calculated as the largest difference in the total weight of 
all events between the original weights $w_{PU}$ and either of the new sets of weights $w_{PU,\Uparrow}$ or $w_{PU,\Downarrow}$.  
For \DY and \WR the pileup uncertainty was 3\% or less in all $\Mlljj$ windows.

\DY and \WR events were simulated using:
\begin{itemize}
	\item One parton distribution function (PDF) that described how momenta were distributed amongst quark and 
		gluon constituents of colliding protons.  \WR simulations used NNPDF23 \cite{nnpdf23}, \DY simulations 
		used NNPDF30 \cite{nnpdf30}, and both PDFs were parameterized by functions with fixed value coefficients with uncertainties.
	\item One renormalization scale value $\mu_{R}$ (in $\GeV$) that determined the QCD coupling strength $\alpha_{QCD}$.
	\item One factorization scale value $\mu_{F}$ (in $\GeV$), which allowed QCD interactions with low momentum transfer 
		$k_{low} \ll \mu_{F}$ to be simulated independently of QCD interactions with high momentum transfer 
		$k_{high} \sim \mu_{F}$ (explained further in \cite{qcdFactorizationTheory}).
\end{itemize}
The effect of PDF uncertainties, and $\mu_{R}$ and $\mu_{F}$ (QCD scale) uncertainties were estimated by resimulating \DY and 
\WR events with different PDF coefficients and QCD scale values, and subsequently reapplying all event corrections and 
selections.  The QCD scales were independently increased or decreased by a factor of 2 (both were doubled, one was not changed 
while the other was halved, etc), and the QCD scale uncertainty was calculated as the maximum change in selected events between 
the original scales and any other scales.  Similarly, the PDF coefficients were increased and decreased independently to test 
$\sim$300 different sets of PDF coefficients, and the PDF uncertainty was calculated as the average change in the number of events 
between the original PDF coefficients and any other set of coefficients.  In \DY events the QCD scale uncertainty added in 
quadrature with the PDF uncertainty never exceeded 4\% in any $\Mlljj$ window.  The same procedures were used to estimate the QCD 
scale and PDF uncertainties in \WR events.  There the QCD scale uncertainty never exceeded 5\% for any \mWR hypothesis, but the 
PDF uncertainty increased with from 1\% to 15\% as \mWR increased from 0.8 to 4 $\TeV$, as shown in Table \ref{tab:wrPdfAndQCDscaleUnc}.  
Following CMS guidelines, the \WR PDF uncertainty was factored into two parts: one part that affected the \WR production rate, 
and another part that affected the $(\eta,\phi)$ trajectories of final state leptons and jets.  The PDF uncertainty affecting 
$(\eta,\phi)$ was included in limit calculations, and was $\lesssim$ 1\% for all \mWR hypotheses.  The remaining PDF uncertainty, 
which grew with \mWR, varied with the specific LRS model realization being tested, so it was not included in limit calculations.

These simulated event uncertainties were included in limit calculations using log-normal distributions for the marginal posterior 
distributions.

\subsection{Cumulative Uncertainty}
\label{sec:cumulativeUnc}
The cumulative effect of all uncertainties on the number of ST background and \WR signal events in several $\Mlljj$ windows is 
shown in Table \ref{tab:expectedEventsAndAllUncs}.  All uncertainties excluding the statistical uncertainty are labeled as systematic 
uncertainties, and the magnitudes of all systematic uncertainties are summed in quadrature.  The dominant \DY background uncertainty 
was the 40\% uncertainty assigned based on disagreement between data and simulated ST backgrounds in a control region where good 
agreement was expected.  The dominant top quark background uncertainty was the statistical uncertainty, as fewer than 500 $e\mu$ data 
events passed the full selection with $\Mlljj > 600$ $\GeV$.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:searchResults}
Evidence of LRS models was searched for by comparing selected events in data to ST backgrounds and \WR signals.  Initial 
results were obtained by comparing the $\Meejj$ and $\Mmumujj$ distributions between data and ST backgrounds with 
(Table \ref{tab:expAndObsEvtsWithAllUncs}) and without (Figure \ref{fig:obsAndExpMlljj}) the $\Mlljj$ window cuts.  
No statistically significant excess was found in data relative to backgrounds, so limits on 
$\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ were calculated.

Upper limits on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ were calculated at 95\% CL in each $\Mlljj$ window 
assuming $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$.  Expected limits were calculated by setting the measured number of events $\Nlljj$ 
equal to the number of ST background events, and observed limits were calculated by setting $\Nlljj$ equal to the number 
of events found in data.  The expected and observed limits as functions of \mWR are shown in Figure \ref{fig:oneDimLimits}.  
Subsequently, the expected and observed cross section limits for $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$ were extrapolated into \mnul 
and \mWR exclusion limits.

The limits on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ for any \mnul were linearly proportional to the signal 
efficiency $\chi$ of the event selection multiplied by the \WR cross section $\sigma(\WR)$, $\chi \times \sigma(\WR)$.  
Since the estimated background was only sensitive to the \mWR hypothesis, the limits at two points with the same \mWR but 
different \mnul only differed by the ratio of $\chi \times \sigma(\WR)$ at the points.  Since the $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ 
limit was known at $(\mWR^{a}, \mnul^{a} = \frac{1}{2}\mWR^{a})$, the limit at any other point $(\mWR^{a}, \mnul^{b} \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR^{a})$ 
could be calculated as:

\begin{equation}
	Limit[(\mWR^{a}, \mnul^{b} \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR^{a})] = \frac{\chi[(\mWR^{a}, \mnul^{b} \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR^{a})]}{\chi[(\mWR^{a}, \mnul^{a} = \frac{1}{2}\mWR^{a})]} \quad Limit[(\mWR^{a}, \mnul^{a} = \frac{1}{2}\mWR^{a})]
\label{eq:limitExtrapolation}
\end{equation}
The dependence of $\chi$ on \mnul and \mWR was estimated by simulating additional $\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj$ samples with 
\mWR increasing from 800 to 4000 $\GeV$ in 100 $\GeV$ steps.  At each \mWR value, at least 20 samples were produced with 
different \mnul values between 0 $\GeV$ and \mWR.  
%in steps of:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item 25 $\GeV$ from 0 to 300 $\GeV$,
%	\item 100 $\GeV$ from 300 to $\mWR - 200$ $\GeV$,
%	\item 25 $\GeV$ from $\mWR - 200$ to \mWR $\GeV$
%\end{itemize}
%Smaller steps were used in regions where $\chi$ had a strong dependence on \mnul.
The standard full simulation and reconstruction used to produce \WR samples with $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$ required enormous 
computational resources that were not available for the limit extrapolation procedure described here.  Instead, additional \WR 
simulations were produced using only the first simulation step.  \PYTHIA simulated the \WR production and decay into leptons 
and quarks, and the hadronization of quarks into jets.  Similar to reconstructed jets, jets from \PYTHIA were clustered from 
individual hadrons, leptons and photons in a cone of radius $\Delta R =$ 0.4.  After jet clustering, the offline selection was 
applied, excluding lepton and jet ID selections.  The efficiency of this selection $\chi^'$ was measured as a function of 
$(\mWR, \mnul)$, and used in place of $\chi$.  Then, $\chi^'$ and Equation \ref{eq:limitExtrapolation} were used to extrapolate 
the $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ limits calculated for $\mnul = \frac{1}{2}\mWR$ to new limits $L'$ for 
$\mnul \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR$.  The resulting $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ limits were rescaled by $\sigma(\WR)$ 
for $\mnul \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR$ to obtain the \mnul and \mWR exclusion limits at 95\% CL shown in Figure \ref{fig:twoDimLimits}.

The difference between the selection efficiencies $\chi^'$, without reconstruction, and $\chi$ was estimated by simulating 
$\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj$ at $\mWR =$ 2400 and 4000 $\GeV$ and several $\mnul \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR$ with detector 
response simulations and particle reconstruction, and calculating limits with these events.  Simulated events were selected with the online and offline selection 
requirements, and the limits $L_{true}$ on $\sigma(\WR) \times BR(\WR \rightarrow \ell\ell jj)$ were calculated at each 
$(\mWR, \mnul \neq \frac{1}{2}\mWR)$ point.  For $\mnul \gtrsim \frac{1}{8}\mWR$, $L_{true}$ and $L'$ were consistent 
within their uncertainties.  For $\mnul \lesssim \frac{1}{8}\mWR$, the limit $L_{true}$ was stronger than $L'$ because of 
pileup jets.  $L_{true}$ was calculated using simulated events that included pileup interactions, on average 10 per event, that 
produced pileup jets, which enabled more \WR events to pass the full selection.  The resulting increase in signal selection 
efficiency $\chi$ extended the excluded \WR production region to lower \mnul values.  Although $\chi > \chi^'$ in this region, 
both signal selection efficiencies were below 10\%, and at every \mWR value the difference in the lowest excluded \mnul between 
$L_{true}$ and $L'$ was less than 100 $\GeV$.  The extrapolated limit $L'$ represented the result, and no correction was applied 
to it because $L'$ was weaker than $L_{true}$.
