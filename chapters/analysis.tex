$m_{1} = $ mass of cart which is initially stationary = $4.00$ kg
$m_{2} = $ mass of cart which is initially moving = $2.00$ kg
$v_{i2} = $ initially velocity of cart $2$ with mass $m_{2}$ = $2.00$ kg


a. center of mass velocity is $0.67 \frac{m}{s}$
$v_{cm} = \frac{v_{i2}m_{2}}{m_{1} + m_{2}} = \frac{2}{3} \frac{m}{s}$

b. in the moving center of mass frame, cart $1$ moves with velocity $-0.67 \frac{m}{s}$
and cart $2$ moves with velocity $1.33 \frac{m}{s}$

c. final velocity of cart $1$ is $1.33 \frac{m}{s}$, and the final velocity
of cart $2$ is $-0.67 \frac{m}{s}$

the final velocities of both carts are unknown, but the final velocity of one cart
can be expressed in terms of the final velocity of the other cart and the initial
velocity $v_{i2}$ of cart $2$ using momentum conservation.

$m_{2}v_{i2} = m_{2}v_{f2} + m_{1}v_{f1} \rightarrow v_{f1} = \frac{m_{2}v_{i2} - m_{2}v_{f2}}{m_{1}}$

The collision is elastic, so kinetic energy is conserved.  This expression for $v_{f1}$
can be substituted into the kinetic energy conservation equation.  After this substitution,
the only unknown in the kinetic energy conservation equation is the final velocity $v_{f2}$
of cart $2$.  The kinetic energy conservation equation after substitution is

(1/2)$m_{2}v_{i2}^{2}$ = (1/2)$m_{1}(\frac{1}{m_{1}^{2}})(m_{2}^{2}v_{i2}^{2} - 2m_{2}^{2}v_{i2}v_{f2} + m_{2}^{2}v_{f2}^{2})$ + (1/2)$m_{2}v_{f2}^{2}$

solving for $v_{f2} = -0.67 \frac{m}{s}$, so cart $2$ which was moving before the collision
changes direction after the elastic collision.

Using momentum conservation, $v_{f1} = 1.33 \frac{m}{s}$.


d. after the collision the center of mass velocity = $0.67 \frac{m}{s}$, same as before the collision

$v_{cm} = \frac{v_{f2}m_{2} + v_{f1}m_{1}}{m_{1} + m_{2}} = \frac{2}{3} \frac{m}{s}$


e. the kinetic energy before and after the collision are both equal to
 (1/2)$m_{2}v_{i2}^{2}$ = $4.00$ Joules.


f. cart $2$ impulse on cart $1$ = -$\Delta p_{2} = -m_{2}(v_{f2} - v_{i2}) = 5.33 \frac{kg m}{s}$
cart $1$ impulse on cart $2$ = -$\Delta p_{1} = -m_{1}(v_{f1} - v_{i1}) = -5.33 \frac{kg m}{s}$


g. average force of cart $1$ on cart $2$ $F_{ave} = \frac{-\Delta p_{1}}{\Delta t} = 
-\frac{1}{0.05 s} \frac{16}{3} \frac{kg m}{s} \rightarrow F_{ave} = -107$ Newtons



h. velocity of both carts after collision = $0.67 \frac{m}{s}$

use momentum conservation to find the velocity of both carts after they collide and stick
$m_{2}v_{i2} = (m_{2} + m_{1})v_{f} \rightarrow v_{f} = 0.67 \frac{m}{s}$


i. kinetic energy after the collision = (1/2)$(m_{2} + m_{1})v_{f}^{2} = 1.33$ Joules



j. cart $2$ impulse on cart $1$ = -$\Delta p_{2} = -m_{2}(v_{f} - v_{i2}) = 2.67 \frac{kg m}{s}$
cart $1$ impulse on cart $2$ = -$\Delta p_{1} = -m_{1}(v_{f} - v_{i1}) = -2.67 \frac{kg m}{s}$



k. average force of cart $1$ on cart $2$ $F_{ave} = \frac{-\Delta p_{1}}{\Delta t} = 
-\frac{1}{0.05 s} \frac{8}{3} \frac{kg m}{s} \rightarrow F_{ave} = -53.3$ Newtons
