$m_{1} = $ mass of cart which is initially stationary = $4.00$ kg\newline
$m_{2} = $ mass of cart which is initially moving = $2.00$ kg\newline
$v_{i2} = $ initially velocity of cart $2$ with mass $m_{2}$ = $2.00 \frac{m}{s}$\newline


a. center of mass velocity is $0.67 \frac{m}{s}$\newline
$v_{cm} = \frac{v_{i2}m_{2}}{m_{1} + m_{2}} = \frac{2}{3} \frac{m}{s}$\newline
b. in the moving center of mass frame, cart $1$ moves with velocity $-0.67 \frac{m}{s}$\newline
and cart $2$ moves with velocity $1.33 \frac{m}{s}$\newline
c. final velocity of cart $1$ is $1.33 \frac{m}{s}$, and the final velocity\newline
of cart $2$ is $-0.67 \frac{m}{s}$\newline
the final velocities of both carts are unknown, but the final velocity of one cart\newline
can be expressed in terms of the final velocity of the other cart and the initial\newline
velocity $v_{i2}$ of cart $2$ using momentum conservation.\newline
$m_{2}v_{i2} = m_{2}v_{f2} + m_{1}v_{f1} \rightarrow v_{f1} = \frac{m_{2}v_{i2} - m_{2}v_{f2}}{m_{1}}$\newline
The collision is elastic, so kinetic energy is conserved.  This expression for $v_{f1}$\newline
can be substituted into the kinetic energy conservation equation.  After this substitution,\newline
the only unknown in the kinetic energy conservation equation is the final velocity $v_{f2}$\newline
of cart $2$.  The kinetic energy conservation equation after substitution is\newline
(1/2)$m_{2}v_{i2}^{2}$ = (1/2)$m_{1}(\frac{1}{m_{1}^{2}})(m_{2}^{2}v_{i2}^{2} - 2m_{2}^{2}v_{i2}v_{f2} + m_{2}^{2}v_{f2}^{2})$ + (1/2)$m_{2}v_{f2}^{2}$\newline
solving for $v_{f2} = -0.67 \frac{m}{s}$, so cart $2$ which was moving before the collision\newline
changes direction after the elastic collision.\newline

Using momentum conservation, $v_{f1} = 1.33 \frac{m}{s}$.\newline


d. after the collision the center of mass velocity = $0.67 \frac{m}{s}$, same as before the collision\newline

$v_{cm} = \frac{v_{f2}m_{2} + v_{f1}m_{1}}{m_{1} + m_{2}} = \frac{2}{3} \frac{m}{s}$\newline


e. the kinetic energy before and after the collision are both equal to
 (1/2)$m_{2}v_{i2}^{2}$ = $4.00$ Joules.\newline


f. cart $2$ impulse on cart $1$ = -$\Delta p_{2} = -m_{2}(v_{f2} - v_{i2}) = 5.33 \frac{kg m}{s}$\newline
cart $1$ impulse on cart $2$ = -$\Delta p_{1} = -m_{1}(v_{f1} - v_{i1}) = -5.33 \frac{kg m}{s}$\newline


g. average force of cart $1$ on cart $2$ $F_{ave} = \frac{-\Delta p_{1}}{\Delta t} = 
-\frac{1}{0.05 s} \frac{16}{3} \frac{kg m}{s} \rightarrow F_{ave} = -107$ Newtons\newline



h. velocity of both carts after collision = $0.67 \frac{m}{s}$\newline

use momentum conservation to find the velocity of both carts after they collide and stick\newline
$m_{2}v_{i2} = (m_{2} + m_{1})v_{f} \rightarrow v_{f} = 0.67 \frac{m}{s}$\newline


i. kinetic energy after the collision = (1/2)$(m_{2} + m_{1})v_{f}^{2} = 1.33$ Joules\newline



j. cart $2$ impulse on cart $1$ = -$\Delta p_{2} = -m_{2}(v_{f} - v_{i2}) = 2.67 \frac{kg m}{s}$\newline
cart $1$ impulse on cart $2$ = -$\Delta p_{1} = -m_{1}(v_{f} - v_{i1}) = -2.67 \frac{kg m}{s}$\newline



k. average force of cart $1$ on cart $2$ $F_{ave} = \frac{-\Delta p_{1}}{\Delta t} = 
-\frac{1}{0.05 s} \frac{8}{3} \frac{kg m}{s} \rightarrow F_{ave} = -53.3$ Newtons
