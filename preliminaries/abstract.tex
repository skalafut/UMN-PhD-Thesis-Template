A search for a heavy right-handed \WR boson, and heavy right-handed neutrinos \nul ($\ell = \Pe, \mu$) performed by the 
CMS experiment is summarized here.  Using the 2.6 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity recorded by the CMS experiment in

2015 at a center-of-mass energy of 13\TeV, this search seeks evidence of a \WR boson and \nul neutrinos in events with two 
leptons and two jets.  The data do not significantly exceed expected backgrounds, and are consistent with expected results 
given uncertainties.  For Standard Model extensions with strict left-right symmetry, and assuming only one \nul flavor contributes 
significantly to the \WR decay width, mass limits are set in the two-dimensional $(\mWR, \mnul)$ plane at 95\% confidence 
level.  The limits extend to $\mWR$ of 3.3\TeV (3.5\TeV) in the electron (muon) channel, and span awide range of $\mnul$ 
values below $\mWR$.
