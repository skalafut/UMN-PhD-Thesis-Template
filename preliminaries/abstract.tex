A search for a heavy right-handed \WR boson, and heavy right-handed neutrinos \nul ($\ell = e, \mu$) performed by the 
CMS experiment is summarized here.  Using the 2.6 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity recorded by the CMS experiment in
2015 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 $\TeV$, this search seeks evidence of a \WR boson and \nul neutrinos in events with two 
leptons and two jets.  The data do not significantly exceed expected backgrounds, and are consistent with expected results 
of the Standard Theory given uncertainties.  For Standard Theory extensions with strict left-right symmetry, and assuming 
only one \nul flavor contributes significantly to the \WR decay width, mass limits are set in the two-dimensional $(\mWR, \mnul)$ 
plane at 95\% confidence level.  The limits extend to a \WR mass of 3.3 $\TeV$ in the electron channel and 3.5 $\TeV$ in the muon 
channel, and span a wide range of \nul masses below $\mWR$.
